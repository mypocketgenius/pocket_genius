## The Opportunity

### The Problem We Solve

Prominent content experts consistently report that their audiences crave one-on-one help applying concepts to their unique situations. But there are fundamental capacity constraints when it comes to experts personalising what they teach.

Leading creators like Justin Welsh, Sahil Bloom, and Daniel Vassallo all acknowledge this reality — the supply of expert time simply cannot meet demand.

**The Gap:**
- Educational products: ~$50-200
- Bespoke consulting: ~$3,000/hr
- **Unmet demand in the middle**

### Our Solution

Pocket Genius enhances experts' content by making it personalised. We create AI chatbots trained on expert methods to do a single task exceptionally well.

**Chatbot Types:**
- **Framework chats** — Single task focus (e.g., "Write the Perfect Landing Page", "Review my Resume")
- **Deep dives** — Comprehensive exploration of a single work
- **Body of work** — Everything from a single author
- **Advisor boards** — Combined expertise from multiple authors

**Business Model:**
- Users pay per usage (up to $600/month per chatbot)
- Revenue split between Pocket Genius and expert
- Unit economics: Charge $35+ per transformation for ~$0.10 in token costs

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Phase 1: Creative Commons Foundation (No Permission Required)

Start with established, freely-available frameworks that have existing communities:

**Target Frameworks:**
1. **Scrum Methodology** — Agile practitioners, product managers, dev teams
2. **Business Model Canvas** — Entrepreneurs, startup founders, business students
3. **OKRs (Objectives & Key Results)** — Managers, team leads, executives
4. **Jobs to Be Done** — Product managers, UX researchers

**Distribution Channels:**
- Reddit communities (r/scrum, r/agile, r/startups, r/entrepreneur)
- LinkedIn groups
- Indie Hackers
- Product Hunt
- Hacker News

### Phase 2: Accessible Authors

Once we have traction and case studies, approach:
- Newsletter writers with 5k-50k subscribers
- Substack authors in business/productivity niches
- Podcast hosts with modest followings
- Self-published authors on Gumroad/Amazon

### Phase 3: Established Experts

With proven results, work up to:
- Authors with bestselling books
- Course creators with large audiences
- Eventually: Justin Welsh, Sahil Bloom, Daniel Vassallo tier

## Key Metrics to Track

| Metric | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| Transformations/month | Direct revenue driver |
| Conversion rate (visitor → paid) | Marketing efficiency |
| Repeat usage rate | Stickiness, recurring revenue |
| Expert pipeline | Future growth |
| Cost per transformation | Margin health |

---

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Low initial demand | Start with proven communities (Scrum, BMC have huge existing audiences) |
| Authors won't partner | Build traction with creative commons first; approach with data |
| High churn | Focus on recurring use cases; embed in workflows |
| Competition | Defensible moat through expert relationships + custom workflows |

---

## Why This Will Work

1. **No permission needed to start** — Creative commons frameworks let us launch immediately
2. **Existing communities** — Scrum/Agile/Canvas practitioners are already gathered and searching for help
3. **Incredible unit economics** — $17+ margin per $0.10 cost
4. **Proof builds momentum** — Each success makes the next author easier to recruit
5. **Experts are incentivized** — They earn from their existing content with zero extra work

---

## Next Actions

1. Finalize and deploy Scrum Methodology chatbot
2. Finalize and deploy Business Model Canvas chatbot
3. Write launch posts for Reddit/Indie Hackers
4. Set transformation price point ($35 starting)
5. Track first 10 paying users obsessively
