# Prompt for Generating Expansion Pill Labels

## Context: Pocket Genius Platform

Pocket Genius is an AI-based RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) platform where users converse with creator content (books, guides, etc.). The AI personalizes content to each user's specific context and challenges. Users answer intake questions before using chatbots, providing context about their situation, goals, and needs.

## The Two Pill Systems

### Expansion Pills (What We're Designing)
- **Static and Universal**: Same 4-5 pills appear for ALL chatbots and ALL messages
- **Never Change**: Labels remain constant across all conversations
- **Dual Purpose**:
  1. **User Friction Reduction**: Prefill common follow-up questions (users click instead of typing)
  2. **Creator Signal-Gathering**: Aggregate usage data to identify content gaps and understand how users interact with content
- **Data Collection**: When clicked, logs to `Pill_Usage` table with:
  - Which pill was clicked
  - Which content chunks were shown (but didn't satisfy)
  - User's customized text (if modified)
  - User context (from intake questions)
- **Content Gap Analysis**: High usage of a pill = creators see "47 users clicked 'X'" = signal that content is missing or insufficient

### Contextual Follow-Up Pills (Already Implemented)
- **Dynamic and Message-Specific**: AI generates 2-4 unique pills per assistant message
- **Change Every Message**: Each response gets different contextual questions
- **Purpose**: Reduce friction with message-specific conversation continuations
- **Examples**: "Tell me more about terrain advantages", "Give examples of successful strategies", "How would I apply this in practice?"
- **Generated By**: GPT-4o analyzes each specific message and generates relevant follow-ups

## Constraints for Expansion Pills

### Primary Constraints (Critical)

1. **Universal Applicability**
   - Must work across ALL of the following content types (business books, self-help, marketing books, sales books, strategy books, etc.)
   - Must make sense regardless of topic or domain
   - Cannot be domain-specific (e.g., "Show me battle tactics" wouldn't work for business content)

2. **Dual Purpose Balance**
   - Must provide immediate utility to users (they want to click it)
   - Must generate meaningful signals for creators (aggregated data is actionable)
   - Each pill should map to a clear content gap category creators can act on

3. **Non-Overlap with Contextual Pills**
   - Must NOT replicate what contextual pills do (message-specific questions)
   - Should capture BROAD, UNIVERSAL needs that contextual pills can't (since contextual pills are specific)
   - Think: "What do users ALWAYS need, regardless of message content?"

### Secondary Constraints (Important)

4. **Signal Quality for Creators**
   - When aggregated, data should tell creators: "Users need more X in my content"
   - Should map to actionable content types creators can produce:
     - Examples, case studies, proof
     - Step-by-step guides, implementation
     - Deeper explanations, details
     - Scripts, templates, checklists
     - Alternatives, edge cases
   - Should help creators prioritize: "Which content gaps matter most?"

5. **User Psychology**
   - Should feel natural and conversational
   - Should be clear what the user will get
   - Should reduce cognitive load (user doesn't need to think about phrasing)

6. **Technical Constraints**
   - Short enough to fit in pill button (typically 3-8 words)
   - Natural language (sounds like a real question)
   - Actionable (user knows what response they'll get)

## Current Expansion Pills (For Reference)

These are being evaluated and may be replaced:

1. **"Give me an example"** - Requests concrete instances
2. **"How would I actually use this?"** - Requests practical application guidance
3. **"Say more about this"** - Requests deeper explanation
4. **"Who's done this?"** - Requests case studies or real-world instances

**Analysis of Current Pills:**
- "Give me an example" - Universal ✓, Clear signal ✓, May overlap with contextual pills ✗
- "How would I actually use this?" - Universal ✓, Clear signal ✓, May overlap ✗
- "Say more about this" - Universal ✓, Weak signal (too vague) ✗, Overlaps with contextual ✗
- "Who's done this?" - Universal ✓, Clear signal ✓, Less overlap ✓

## What Makes a Good Expansion Pill?

### Evaluation Criteria

For each potential pill, evaluate:

1. **Universality**: Would this make sense for a business book, self-help guide, technical manual, and fiction analysis? (Score 1-5)
2. **User Utility**: Would users frequently want to click this? (Score 1-5)
3. **Signal Clarity**: When creators see "47 users clicked this", do they know what content to create? (Score 1-5)
4. **Non-Overlap**: Does this capture something contextual pills CAN'T (since contextual pills are message-specific)? (Score 1-5)
5. **Actionability**: Can creators act on this signal? (e.g., "need more examples" → create examples) (Score 1-5)

### Pill Categories to Consider

**Format Requests** (users need specific formats):
- Scripts ("Give me exact words")
- Templates ("Give me a template")
- Checklists ("Give me a checklist")
- Steps ("Break this down into steps")

**Gap Types** (users need different content types):
- Examples (concrete instances)
- Proof (evidence, research, validation)
- Application (how to use/implement)
- Depth (more detail/explanation)
- Alternatives (other options/approaches)
- Edge Cases (what if scenarios)

**User Intent** (what users are trying to accomplish):
- Understanding ("I don't get this")
- Application ("How do I use this?")
- Validation ("Is this true/proven?")
- Customization ("What about my situation?")
- Next Steps ("What should I do now?")

## Task

Generate **4-5 expansion pill labels** that meet ALL constraints above.

### Output Format

For each pill, provide:

```json
{
  "label": "Exact text for pill button (3-8 words)",
  "rationale": "Why this pill meets all constraints (2-3 sentences)",
  "universalityScore": 5,
  "userUtilityScore": 5,
  "signalClarityScore": 5,
  "nonOverlapScore": 5,
  "actionabilityScore": 5,
  "contentGapSignal": "What creators learn: 'X users need Y type of content'",
  "contentTypeMapped": "Examples | Proof | Application | Depth | Alternatives | Edge Cases | Format",
  "exampleUsage": "Example of when user would click this (1 sentence)"
}
```

### Final Output

Provide a JSON array with 4-5 pills:

```json
{
  "pills": [
    {
      "label": "...",
      "rationale": "...",
      "universalityScore": 5,
      "userUtilityScore": 5,
      "signalClarityScore": 5,
      "nonOverlapScore": 5,
      "actionabilityScore": 5,
      "contentGapSignal": "...",
      "contentTypeMapped": "...",
      "exampleUsage": "..."
    },
    // ... 3-4 more pills
  ],
  "summary": "Brief explanation of how this set of 4-5 pills collectively meets all constraints and provides comprehensive coverage"
}
```

### Key Questions to Answer

1. **How do these pills differ from contextual pills?** (Contextual pills are message-specific; expansion pills are universal needs)
2. **What signals do creators get?** (Each pill should map to a clear content gap type)
3. **Why are these universal?** (Each pill should work across all content types)
4. **How do they reduce friction?** (Users should frequently want to click them)
5. **What's the coverage?** (Do these 4-5 pills capture the main universal user needs?)

### Success Criteria

A successful set of expansion pills will:
- ✅ Work universally across all content types
- ✅ Provide clear, actionable signals to creators
- ✅ Reduce user friction (users want to click them)
- ✅ NOT overlap with contextual pills (which are message-specific)
- ✅ Map to distinct content gap categories creators can act on
- ✅ Be short, natural, and actionable
