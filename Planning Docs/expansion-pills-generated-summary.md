# Generated Expansion Pills

## Summary

This set of 5 expansion pills addresses universal user needs that transcend specific message content. Each pill maps to a distinct content gap category creators can act on, provides clear signals when aggregated, and captures needs that contextual pills cannot address (since contextual pills are message-specific).

## The 5 Expansion Pills

### 1. "Show me proof"
- **Content Gap Signal**: X users need more proof, evidence, research citations, or validation in this content
- **Content Type**: Proof
- **Why Universal**: Users always want to know if claims are backed by research, data, or real-world validation
- **Why Different from Contextual**: Addresses meta-question of credibility, not topic-specific content
- **Example**: After reading about a business strategy, user clicks to see research studies or case data supporting the claim

### 2. "Give me a template"
- **Content Gap Signal**: X users need templates, scripts, checklists, or structured formats they can use immediately
- **Content Type**: Format
- **Why Universal**: Users frequently need structured, reusable formats across all content types
- **Why Different from Contextual**: About format/structure rather than topic-specific content
- **Example**: User reads about negotiation tactics and clicks to get a conversation script template they can use

### 3. "What if this doesn't work?"
- **Content Gap Signal**: X users need more information about edge cases, risks, troubleshooting, or alternative approaches
- **Content Type**: Edge Cases
- **Why Universal**: Users always want to understand failure modes and alternatives
- **Why Different from Contextual**: Asks about failure modes/edge cases, not the topic itself
- **Example**: After learning a productivity technique, user clicks to understand when it might fail or what alternatives exist

### 4. "Break this into steps"
- **Content Gap Signal**: X users need more step-by-step implementation guides and sequential instructions
- **Content Type**: Application
- **Why Universal**: Users always benefit from structured, sequential implementation guidance
- **Why Different from Contextual**: Requests structural transformation, not topic-specific questions
- **Example**: User reads about a marketing concept and clicks to see it broken down into a clear 5-step implementation process

### 5. "Who's done this successfully?"
- **Content Gap Signal**: X users need more case studies, success stories, or real-world examples of this working
- **Content Type**: Examples
- **Why Universal**: Users want to see proof that concepts work in practice
- **Why Different from Contextual**: About finding examples/validation, not understanding the concept
- **Example**: After learning about a leadership principle, user clicks to see companies or leaders who successfully applied it

## Coverage Analysis

### How These Differ from Contextual Pills
- **Contextual pills**: Message-specific questions about the topic (e.g., "Tell me more about terrain advantages")
