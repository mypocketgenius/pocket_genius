Users always want to know if claims are backed by research, data, or real-world validation. Unlike contextual pills that ask about specific topics, this addresses the meta-question of credibility that applies universally.

  "summary": "This set of 5 expansion pills collectively addresses universal user needs that transcend specific message content: validation (proof), structure (templates), risk awareness (edge cases), implementation (steps), and real-world validation (case studies). Each pill maps to a distinct content gap category creators can act on, provides clear signals when aggregated, and captures needs that contextual pills cannot address since contextual pills are message-specific. Together, they cover the spectrum of universal user intents: understanding credibility, needing formats, anticipating problems, requiring structure, and seeking validation. All pills are short (3-6 words), natural-sounding, and immediately actionable for both users and creators."
