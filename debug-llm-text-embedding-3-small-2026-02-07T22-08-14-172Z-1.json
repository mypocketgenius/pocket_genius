    "## Chapter VIII. VARIATION OF TACTICS\n\n10\\. Reduce the hostile chiefs by inflicting damage on them;\n\n[Chia Lin enumerates several ways of inflicting this injury, some of which would only occur to the Oriental mind:—\"Entice away the enemy’s best and wisest men, so that he may be left without counselors. Introduce traitors into his country, that the government policy may be rendered futile. Foment intrigue and deceit, and thus sow dissension between the ruler and his ministers. By means of every artful contrivance, cause deterioration amongst his men and waste of his treasure. Corrupt his morals by insidious gifts leading him into excess. Disturb and unsettle his mind by presenting him with lovely women.\" Chang Yu (after Wang Hsi) makes a different interpretation of Sun Tzŭ here: \"Get the enemy into a position where he must suffer injury, and he will submit of his own accord.\"]\n\nand make trouble for them,\n\n[Tu Mu, in this phrase, in his interpretation indicates that trouble should be made for the enemy affecting their \"possessions,\" or, as we might say, \"assets,\" which he considers to be \"a large army, a rich exchequer, harmony amongst the soldiers, punctual fulfillment of commands.\" These give us a whip-hand over the enemy.]\n\nand keep them constantly engaged;\n\n[Literally, \"make servants of them.\" Tu Yu says \"prevent them from having any rest.\"]\n\nhold out specious allurements, and make them rush to any given point.",
    "## Chapter VIII. VARIATION OF TACTICS\n\n[Meng Shih’s note contains an excellent example of the idiomatic use of: \"cause them to forget _pien_ (the reasons for acting otherwise than on their first impulse), and hasten in our direction.\"]",
    "## Chapter VIII. VARIATION OF TACTICS\n\n11\\. The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy’s not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable.",
    "## Chapter VIII. VARIATION OF TACTICS\n\n12\\. There are five dangerous faults which may affect a general: (1) Recklessness, which leads to destruction;\n\n[\"Bravery without forethought,\" as Ts’ao Kung analyzes it, which causes a man to fight blindly and desperately like a mad bull. Such an opponent, says Chang Yu, \"must not be encountered with brute force, but may be lured into an ambush and slain.\" Cf. Wu Tzŭ, chap. IV. ad init.: \"In estimating the character of a general, men are wont to pay exclusive attention to his courage, forgetting that courage is only one out of many qualities which a general should possess. The merely brave man is prone to fight recklessly; and he who fights recklessly, without any perception of what is expedient, must be condemned.\" Ssu-ma Fa, too, makes the incisive remark: \"Simply going to one’s death does not bring about victory.\"]\n\n(2) cowardice, which leads to capture;",
    "## Chapter VIII. VARIATION OF TACTICS\n\n[Ts’ao Kung defines the Chinese word translated here as \"cowardice\" as being of the man \"whom timidity prevents from advancing to seize an advantage,\" and Wang Hsi adds \"who is quick to flee at the sight of danger.\" Meng Shih gives the closer paraphrase \"he who is bent on returning alive,\" this is, the man who will never take a risk. But, as Sun Tzŭ knew, nothing is to be achieved in war unless you are willing to take risks. T’ai Kung said: \"He who lets an advantage slip will subsequently bring upon himself real disaster.\" In 404 A.D., Liu Yu pursued the rebel Huan Hsuan up the Yangtsze and fought a naval battle with him at the island of Ch’eng-hung. The loyal troops numbered only a few thousands, while their opponents were in great force. But Huan Hsuan, fearing the fate which was in store for him should be be overcome, had a light boat made fast to the side of his war-junk, so that he might escape, if necessary, at a moment’s notice. The natural result was that the fighting spirit of his soldiers was utterly quenched, and when the loyalists made an attack from windward with fireships, all striving with the utmost ardor to be first in the fray, Huan Hsuan’s forces were routed, had to burn all their baggage and fled for two days and nights without stopping. Chang Yu tells a somewhat similar story of Chao Ying-ch’i, a general of the Chin State who during a battle with the army of Ch’u in 597 B.C. had a boat kept in readiness for him on the river, wishing in case of defeat to be the first to get across.]",
    "## Chapter VIII. VARIATION OF TACTICS\n\n(3) a hasty temper, which can be provoked by insults;\n\n[Tu Mu tells us that Yao Hsing, when opposed in 357 A.D. by Huang Mei, Teng Ch’iang and others shut himself up behind his walls and refused to fight. Teng Ch’iang said: \"Our adversary is of a choleric temper and easily provoked; let us make constant sallies and break down his walls, then he will grow angry and come out. Once we can bring his force to battle, it is doomed to be our prey.\" This plan was acted upon, Yao Hsiang came out to fight, was lured as far as San-yuan by the enemy’s pretended flight, and finally attacked and slain.]\n\n(4) a delicacy of honour which is sensitive to shame;\n\nThis need not be taken to mean that a sense of honour is really a defect in a general. What Sun Tzŭ condemns is rather an exaggerated sensitiveness to slanderous reports, the thin-skinned man who is stung by opprobrium, however undeserved. Mei Yao-ch’en truly observes, though somewhat paradoxically: \"The seeker after glory should be careless of public opinion.\"]\n\n(5) over-solicitude for his men, which exposes him to worry and trouble.",
    "## Chapter VIII. VARIATION OF TACTICS\n\n[Here again, Sun Tzŭ does not mean that the general is to be careless of the welfare of his troops. All he wishes to emphasize is the danger of sacrificing any important military advantage to the immediate comfort of his men. This is a shortsighted policy, because in the long run the troops will suffer more from the defeat, or, at best, the prolongation of the war, which will be the consequence. A mistaken feeling of pity will often induce a general to relieve a beleaguered city, or to reinforce a hard-pressed detachment, contrary to his military instincts. It is now generally admitted that our repeated efforts to relieve Ladysmith in the South African War were so many strategical blunders which defeated their own purpose. And in the end, relief came through the very man who started out with the distinct resolve no longer to subordinate the interests of the whole to sentiment in favour of a part. An old soldier of one of our generals who failed most conspicuously in this war, tried once, I remember, to defend him to me on the ground that he was always \"so good to his men.\" By this plea, had he but known it, he was only condemning him out of Sun Tzŭ’s mouth.]",
    "## Chapter VIII. VARIATION OF TACTICS\n\n13\\. These are the five besetting sins of a general, ruinous to the conduct of war.\n\n14\\. When an army is overthrown and its leader slain, the cause will surely be found among these five dangerous faults. Let them be a subject of meditation.\n\n[1] \"Marshal Turenne,\" p. 50.",

    "1\\. Sun Tzŭ said: We come now to the question of encamping the army, and observing signs of the enemy. Pass quickly over mountains, and keep in the neighbourhood of valleys.\n\n[The idea is, not to linger among barren uplands, but to keep close to supplies of water and grass. Cf. Wu Tzŭ, ch. 3: \"Abide not in natural ovens,\" i.e. \"the openings of valleys.\" Chang Yu tells the following anecdote: Wu-tu Ch’iang was a robber captain in the time of the Later Han, and Ma Yuan was sent to exterminate his gang. Ch’iang having found a refuge in the hills, Ma Yuan made no attempt to force a battle, but seized all the favourable positions commanding supplies of water and forage. Ch’iang was soon in such a desperate plight for want of provisions that he was forced to make a total surrender. He did not know the advantage of keeping in the neighbourhood of valleys.\"]\n\n2\\. Camp in high places,\n\n[Not on high hills, but on knolls or hillocks elevated above the surrounding country.]\n\nfacing the sun.\n\n[Tu Mu takes this to mean \"facing south,\" and Ch’en Hao \"facing east.\" Cf. infra, §§ 11, 13.\n\nDo not climb heights in order to fight. So much for mountain warfare.",
    "## Chapter IX. THE ARMY ON THE MARCH\n\n3\\. After crossing a river, you should get far away from it.\n\n[\"In order to tempt the enemy to cross after you,\" according to Ts’ao Kung, and also, says Chang Yu, \"in order not to be impeded in your evolutions.\" The _T’ung Tien_ reads, \"If _the enemy_ crosses a river,\" etc. But in view of the next sentence, this is almost certainly an interpolation.]",
    "## Chapter IX. THE ARMY ON THE MARCH\n\n4\\. When an invading force crosses a river in its onward march, do not advance to meet it in mid-stream. It will be best to let half the army get across, and then deliver your attack.\n\n[Li Ch’uan alludes to the great victory won by Han Hsin over Lung Chu at the Wei River. Turning to the _Ch’ien Han Shu_, ch. 34, fol. 6 verso, we find the battle described as follows: \"The two armies were drawn up on opposite sides of the river. In the night, Han Hsin ordered his men to take some ten thousand sacks filled with sand and construct a dam higher up. Then, leading half his army across, he attacked Lung Chu; but after a time, pretending to have failed in his attempt, he hastily withdrew to the other bank. Lung Chu was much elated by this unlooked-for success, and exclaiming: \"I felt sure that Han Hsin was really a coward!\" he pursued him and began crossing the river in his turn. Han Hsin now sent a party to cut open the sandbags, thus releasing a great volume of water, which swept down and prevented the greater portion of Lung Chu’s army from getting across. He then turned upon the force which had been cut off, and annihilated it, Lung Chu himself being amongst the slain. The rest of the army, on the further bank, also scattered and fled in all directions.]\n\n5\\. If you are anxious to fight, you should not go to meet the invader near a river which he has to cross.\n\n[For fear of preventing his crossing.]",
    "## Chapter IX. THE ARMY ON THE MARCH\n\n6\\. Moor your craft higher up than the enemy, and facing the sun.\n\n[See _supra_, § 2. The repetition of these words in connection with water is very awkward. Chang Yu has the note: \"Said either of troops marshalled on the river-bank, or of boats anchored in the stream itself; in either case it is essential to be higher than the enemy and facing the sun.\" The other commentators are not at all explicit.]\n\nDo not move up-stream to meet the enemy.\n\n[Tu Mu says: \"As water flows downwards, we must not pitch our camp on the lower reaches of a river, for fear the enemy should open the sluices and sweep us away in a flood. Chu-ko Wu-hou has remarked that ‘in river warfare we must not advance against the stream,’ which is as much as to say that our fleet must not be anchored below that of the enemy, for then they would be able to take advantage of the current and make short work of us.\" There is also the danger, noted by other commentators, that the enemy may throw poison on the water to be carried down to us.]\n\nSo much for river warfare.\n\n7\\. In crossing salt-marshes, your sole concern should be to get over them quickly, without any delay.\n\n[Because of the lack of fresh water, the poor quality of the herbage, and last but not least, because they are low, flat, and exposed to attack.]",
    "## Chapter IX. THE ARMY ON THE MARCH\n\n8\\. If forced to fight in a salt-marsh, you should have water and grass near you, and get your back to a clump of trees.\n\n[Li Ch’uan remarks that the ground is less likely to be treacherous where there are trees, while Tu Mu says that they will serve to protect the rear.]\n\nSo much for operations in salt-marshes.\n\n9\\. In dry, level country, take up an easily accessible position with rising ground to your right and on your rear,\n\n[Tu Mu quotes T’ai Kung as saying: \"An army should have a stream or a marsh on its left, and a hill or tumulus on its right.\"]\n\nso that the danger may be in front, and safety lie behind. So much for campaigning in flat country.",
    "## Chapter IX. THE ARMY ON THE MARCH\n\n10\\. These are the four useful branches of military knowledge\n\n[Those, namely, concerned with (1) mountains, (2) rivers, (3) marshes, and (4) plains. Compare Napoleon’s \"Military Maxims,\" no. 1.]\n\nwhich enabled the Yellow Emperor to vanquish four several sovereigns.\n\n[Regarding the \"Yellow Emperor\": Mei Yao-ch’en asks, with some plausibility, whether there is an error in the text as nothing is known of Huang Ti having conquered four other Emperors. The _Shih Chi_ (ch. 1 ad init.) speaks only of his victories over Yen Ti and Ch’ih Yu. In the _Liu T’ao_ it is mentioned that he \"fought seventy battles and pacified the Empire.\" Ts’ao Kung’s explanation is, that the Yellow Emperor was the first to institute the feudal system of vassals princes, each of whom (to the number of four) originally bore the title of Emperor. Li Ch’uan tells us that the art of war originated under Huang Ti, who received it from his Minister Feng Hou.]\n\n11\\. All armies prefer high ground to low,\n\n[\"High Ground,\" says Mei Yao-ch’en, \"is not only more agreeable and salubrious, but more convenient from a military point of view; low ground is not only damp and unhealthy, but also disadvantageous for fighting.\"]\n\nand sunny places to dark.",
    "## Chapter IX. THE ARMY ON THE MARCH\n\n12\\. If you are careful of your men,\n\n[Ts’ao Kung says: \"Make for fresh water and pasture, where you can turn out your animals to graze.\"]\n\nand camp on hard ground, the army will be free from disease of every kind,\n\n[Chang Yu says: \"The dryness of the climate will prevent the outbreak of illness.\"]\n\nand this will spell victory.\n\n13\\. When you come to a hill or a bank, occupy the sunny side, with the slope on your right rear. Thus you will at once act for the benefit of your soldiers and utilise the natural advantages of the ground.\n\n14\\. When, in consequence of heavy rains up-country, a river which you wish to ford is swollen and flecked with foam, you must wait until it subsides.",
    "## Chapter IX. THE ARMY ON THE MARCH\n\n15\\. Country in which there are precipitous cliffs with torrents running between, deep natural hollows,\n\nThe latter defined as \"places enclosed on every side by steep banks, with pools of water at the bottom.\"]\n\nconfined places,\n\n[Defined as \"natural pens or prisons\" or \"places surrounded by precipices on three sides—easy to get into, but hard to get out of.\"]\n\ntangled thickets,\n\n[Defined as \"places covered with such dense undergrowth that spears cannot be used.\"]\n\nquagmires\n\n[Defined as \"low-lying places, so heavy with mud as to be impassable for chariots and horsemen.\"]\n\nand crevasses,\n\n[Defined by Mei Yao-ch’en as \"a narrow difficult way between beetling cliffs.\" Tu Mu’s note is \"ground covered with trees and rocks, and intersected by numerous ravines and pitfalls.\" This is very vague, but Chia Lin explains it clearly enough as a defile or narrow pass, and Chang Yu takes much the same view. On the whole, the weight of the commentators certainly inclines to the rendering \"defile.\" But the ordinary meaning of the Chinese in one place is \"a crack or fissure\" and the fact that the meaning of the Chinese elsewhere in the sentence indicates something in the nature of a defile, make me think that Sun Tzŭ is here speaking of crevasses.]\n\nshould be left with all possible speed and not approached.",
    "## Chapter IX. THE ARMY ON THE MARCH\n\n16\\. While we keep away from such places, we should get the enemy to approach them; while we face them, we should let the enemy have them on his rear.\n\n17\\. If in the neighbourhood of your camp there should be any hilly country, ponds surrounded by aquatic grass, hollow basins filled with reeds, or woods with thick undergrowth, they must be carefully routed out and searched; for these are places where men in ambush or insidious spies are likely to be lurking.\n\n[Chang Yu has the note: \"We must also be on our guard against traitors who may lie in close covert, secretly spying out our weaknesses and overhearing our instructions.\"]\n\n18\\. When the enemy is close at hand and remains quiet, he is relying on the natural strength of his position.\n\n[Here begin Sun Tzŭ’s remarks on the reading of signs, much of which is so good that it could almost be included in a modern manual like Gen. Baden-Powell’s \"Aids to Scouting.\"]\n\n19\\. When he keeps aloof and tries to provoke a battle, he is anxious for the other side to advance.\n\n[Probably because we are in a strong position from which he wishes to dislodge us. \"If he came close up to us, says Tu Mu, \"and tried to force a battle, he would seem to despise us, and there would be less probability of our responding to the challenge.\"]\n\n20\\. If his place of encampment is easy of access, he is tendering a bait.",
    "## Chapter IX. THE ARMY ON THE MARCH\n\n21\\. Movement amongst the trees of a forest shows that the enemy is advancing.\n\n[Ts’ao Kung explains this as \"felling trees to clear a passage,\" and Chang Yu says: \"Every man sends out scouts to climb high places and observe the enemy. If a scout sees that the trees of a forest are moving and shaking, he may know that they are being cut down to clear a passage for the enemy’s march.\"]\n\nThe appearance of a number of screens in the midst of thick grass means that the enemy wants to make us suspicious.\n\n[Tu Yu’s explanation, borrowed from Ts’ao Kung’s, is as follows: \"The presence of a number of screens or sheds in the midst of thick vegetation is a sure sign that the enemy has fled and, fearing pursuit, has constructed these hiding-places in order to make us suspect an ambush.\" It appears that these \"screens\" were hastily knotted together out of any long grass which the retreating enemy happened to come across.]\n\n22\\. The rising of birds in their flight is the sign of an ambuscade.\n\n[Chang Yu’s explanation is doubtless right: \"When birds that are flying along in a straight line suddenly shoot upwards, it means that soldiers are in ambush at the spot beneath.\"]\n\nStartled beasts indicate that a sudden attack is coming.",
    "## Chapter IX. THE ARMY ON THE MARCH\n\n23\\. When there is dust rising in a high column, it is the sign of chariots advancing; when the dust is low, but spread over a wide area, it betokens the approach of infantry.\n\n[\"High and sharp,\" or rising to a peak, is of course somewhat exaggerated as applied to dust. The commentators explain the phenomenon by saying that horses and chariots, being heavier than men, raise more dust, and also follow one another in the same wheel-track, whereas foot-soldiers would be marching in ranks, many abreast. According to Chang Yu, \"every army on the march must have scouts some way in advance, who on sighting dust raised by the enemy, will gallop back and report it to the commander-in-chief.\" Cf. Gen. Baden-Powell: \"As you move along, say, in a hostile country, your eyes should be looking afar for the enemy or any signs of him: figures, dust rising, birds getting up, glitter of arms, etc.\" [1] ]\n\nWhen it branches out in different directions, it shows that parties have been sent to collect firewood. A few clouds of dust moving to and fro signify that the army is encamping.\n\n[Chang Yu says: \"In apportioning the defences for a cantonment, light horse will be sent out to survey the position and ascertain the weak and strong points all along its circumference. Hence the small quantity of dust and its motion.\"]",
    "## Chapter IX. THE ARMY ON THE MARCH\n\n24\\. Humble words and increased preparations are signs that the enemy is about to advance.",
    "## Chapter IX. THE ARMY ON THE MARCH\n\n[\"As though they stood in great fear of us,\" says Tu Mu. \"Their object is to make us contemptuous and careless, after which they will attack us.\" Chang Yu alludes to the story of T’ien Tan of the Ch’i-mo against the Yen forces, led by Ch’i Chieh. In ch. 82 of the _Shih Chi_ we read: \"T’ien Tan openly said: ‘My only fear is that the Yen army may cut off the noses of their Ch’i prisoners and place them in the front rank to fight against us; that would be the undoing of our city.’ The other side being informed of this speech, at once acted on the suggestion; but those within the city were enraged at seeing their fellow-countrymen thus mutilated, and fearing only lest they should fall into the enemy’s hands, were nerved to defend themselves more obstinately than ever. Once again T’ien Tan sent back converted spies who reported these words to the enemy: \"What I dread most is that the men of Yen may dig up the ancestral tombs outside the town, and by inflicting this indignity on our forefathers cause us to become faint-hearted.’ Forthwith the besiegers dug up all the graves and burned the corpses lying in them. And the inhabitants of Chi-mo, witnessing the outrage from the city-walls, wept passionately and were all impatient to go out and fight, their fury being increased tenfold. T’ien Tan knew then that his soldiers were ready for any enterprise. But instead of a sword, he himself took a mattock in his hands, and ordered others to be distributed amongst his best warriors, while the ranks were filled up with their wives and concubines. He then served out all the remaining rations and bade his men eat their fill. The regular soldiers were told to keep out of sight, and the walls were manned with the old and weaker men and with women. This done, envoys were dispatched to the enemy’s camp to arrange terms of surrender, whereupon the Yen army began shouting for joy. T’ien Tan also collected 20,000 ounces of silver from the people, and got the wealthy citizens of Chi-mo to send it to the Yen general with the prayer that, when the town capitulated, he would not allow their homes to be plundered or their women to be maltreated. Ch’i Chieh, in high good humor, granted their prayer; but his army now became increasingly slack and careless. Meanwhile, T’ien Tan got together a thousand oxen, decked them with pieces of red silk, painted their bodies, dragon-like, with colored stripes, and fastened sharp blades on their horns and well-greased rushes on their tails. When night came on, he lighted the ends of the rushes, and drove the oxen through a number of holes which he had pierced in the walls, backing them up with a force of 5000 picked warriors. The animals, maddened with pain, dashed furiously into the enemy’s camp where they caused the utmost confusion and dismay; for their tails acted as torches, showing up the hideous pattern on their bodies, and the weapons on their horns killed or wounded any with whom they came into contact. In the meantime, the band of 5000 had crept up with gags in their mouths, and now threw themselves on the enemy. At the same moment a frightful din arose in the city itself, all those that remained behind making as much noise as possible by banging drums and hammering on bronze vessels, until heaven and earth were convulsed by the uproar. Terror-stricken, the Yen army fled in disorder, hotly pursued by the men of Ch’i, who succeeded in slaying their general Ch’i Chien…. The result of the battle was the ultimate recovery of some seventy cities which had belonged to the Ch’i State.\"]",
    "## Chapter IX. THE ARMY ON THE MARCH\n\nViolent language and driving forward as if to the attack are signs that he will retreat.",
    "## Chapter IX. THE ARMY ON THE MARCH\n\n25\\. When the light chariots come out first and take up a position on the wings, it is a sign that the enemy is forming for battle.\n\n26\\. Peace proposals unaccompanied by a sworn covenant indicate a plot.\n\n[The reading here is uncertain. Li Ch’uan indicates \"a treaty confirmed by oaths and hostages.\" Wang Hsi and Chang Yu, on the other hand, simply say \"without reason,\" \"on a frivolous pretext.\"]\n\n27\\. When there is much running about\n\n[Every man hastening to his proper place under his own regimental banner.]\n\nand the soldiers fall into rank, it means that the critical moment has come.\n\n28\\. When some are seen advancing and some retreating, it is a lure.\n\n29\\. When the soldiers stand leaning on their spears, they are faint from want of food.\n\n30\\. If those who are sent to draw water begin by drinking themselves, the army is suffering from thirst.\n\n[As Tu Mu remarks: \"One may know the condition of a whole army from the behavior of a single man.\"]\n\n31\\. If the enemy sees an advantage to be gained and makes no effort to secure it, the soldiers are exhausted.\n\n32\\. If birds gather on any spot, it is unoccupied.\n\n[A useful fact to bear in mind when, for instance, as Ch’en Hao says, the enemy has secretly abandoned his camp.]\n\nClamour by night betokens nervousness.",
    "## Chapter IX. THE ARMY ON THE MARCH\n\n33\\. If there is disturbance in the camp, the general’s authority is weak. If the banners and flags are shifted about, sedition is afoot. If the officers are angry, it means that the men are weary.\n\n[Tu Mu understands the sentence differently: \"If all the officers of an army are angry with their general, it means that they are broken with fatigue\" owing to the exertions which he has demanded from them.]",
    "## Chapter IX. THE ARMY ON THE MARCH\n\n34\\. When an army feeds its horses with grain and kills its cattle for food,\n\n[In the ordinary course of things, the men would be fed on grain and the horses chiefly on grass.]\n\nand when the men do not hang their cooking-pots over the camp-fires, showing that they will not return to their tents, you may know that they are determined to fight to the death.\n\n[I may quote here the illustrative passage from the _Hou Han Shu_, ch. 71, given in abbreviated form by the _P’ei Wen Yun Fu:_ \"The rebel Wang Kuo of Liang was besieging the town of Ch’en- ts’ang, and Huang-fu Sung, who was in supreme command, and Tung Cho were sent out against him. The latter pressed for hasty measures, but Sung turned a deaf ear to his counsel. At last the rebels were utterly worn out, and began to throw down their weapons of their own accord. Sung was not advancing to the attack, but Cho said: ‘It is a principle of war not to pursue desperate men and not to press a retreating host.’ Sung answered: ‘That does not apply here. What I am about to attack is a jaded army, not a retreating host; with disciplined troops I am falling on a disorganized multitude, not a band of desperate men.’ Thereupon he advances to the attack unsupported by his colleague, and routed the enemy, Wang Kuo being slain.\"]\n\n35\\. The sight of men whispering together in small knots or speaking in subdued tones points to disaffection amongst the rank and file.",
    "## Chapter IX. THE ARMY ON THE MARCH\n\n36\\. Too frequent rewards signify that the enemy is at the end of his resources;\n\n[Because, when an army is hard pressed, as Tu Mu says, there is always a fear of mutiny, and lavish rewards are given to keep the men in good temper.]\n\ntoo many punishments betray a condition of dire distress.\n\n[Because in such case discipline becomes relaxed, and unwonted severity is necessary to keep the men to their duty.]\n\n37\\. To begin by bluster, but afterwards to take fright at the enemy’s numbers, shows a supreme lack of intelligence.\n\n[I follow the interpretation of Ts’ao Kung, also adopted by Li Ch’uan, Tu Mu, and Chang Yu. Another possible meaning set forth by Tu Yu, Chia Lin, Mei Tao-ch’en and Wang Hsi, is: \"The general who is first tyrannical towards his men, and then in terror lest they should mutiny, etc.\" This would connect the sentence with what went before about rewards and punishments.]\n\n38\\. When envoys are sent with compliments in their mouths, it is a sign that the enemy wishes for a truce.\n\n[Tu Mu says: \"If the enemy open friendly relations be sending hostages, it is a sign that they are anxious for an armistice, either because their strength is exhausted or for some other reason.\" But it hardly needs a Sun Tzŭ to draw such an obvious inference.]",
    "## Chapter IX. THE ARMY ON THE MARCH\n\n39\\. If the enemy’s troops march up angrily and remain facing ours for a long time without either joining battle or taking themselves off again, the situation is one that demands great vigilance and circumspection.\n\n[Ts’ao Kung says a manœuver of this sort may be only a ruse to gain time for an unexpected flank attack or the laying of an ambush.]",
    "## Chapter IX. THE ARMY ON THE MARCH\n\n40\\. If our troops are no more in number than the enemy, that is amply sufficient; it only means that no direct attack can be made.\n\n[Literally, \"no martial advance.\" That is to say, _cheng_ tactics and frontal attacks must be eschewed, and stratagem resorted to instead.]\n\nWhat we can do is simply to concentrate all our available strength, keep a close watch on the enemy, and obtain reinforcements.\n\n[This is an obscure sentence, and none of the commentators succeed in squeezing very good sense out of it. I follow Li Ch’uan, who appears to offer the simplest explanation: \"Only the side that gets more men will win.\" Fortunately we have Chang Yu to expound its meaning to us in language which is lucidity itself: \"When the numbers are even, and no favourable opening presents itself, although we may not be strong enough to deliver a sustained attack, we can find additional recruits amongst our sutlers and camp-followers, and then, concentrating our forces and keeping a close watch on the enemy, contrive to snatch the victory. But we must avoid borrowing foreign soldiers to help us.\" He then quotes from Wei Liao Tzŭ, ch. 3: \"The nominal strength of mercenary troops may be 100,000, but their real value will be not more than half that figure.\"]",
    "## Chapter IX. THE ARMY ON THE MARCH\n\n41\\. He who exercises no forethought but makes light of his opponents is sure to be captured by them.\n\n[Ch’en Hao, quoting from the _Tso Chuan_, says: \"If bees and scorpions carry poison, how much more will a hostile state! Even a puny opponent, then, should not be treated with contempt.\"]\n\n42\\. If soldiers are punished before they have grown attached to you, they will not prove submissive; and, unless submissive, then will be practically useless. If, when the soldiers have become attached to you, punishments are not enforced, they will still be useless.\n\n43\\. Therefore soldiers must be treated in the first instance with humanity, but kept under control by means of iron discipline.\n\n[Yen Tzŭ [B.C. 493] said of Ssu-ma Jang-chu: \"His civil virtues endeared him to the people; his martial prowess kept his enemies in awe.\" Cf. Wu Tzŭ, ch. 4 init.: \"The ideal commander unites culture with a warlike temper; the profession of arms requires a combination of hardness and tenderness.\"]\n\nThis is a certain road to victory.\n\n44\\. If in training soldiers commands are habitually enforced, the army will be well-disciplined; if not, its discipline will be bad.",

If a general shows confidence in his men but always insists on his orders being obeyed,\n\n[Tu Mu says: \"A general ought in time of peace to show kindly confidence in his men and also make his authority respected, so that when they come to face the enemy, orders may be executed and discipline maintained, because they all trust and look up to him.\" What Sun Tzŭ has said in § 44, however, would lead one rather to expect something like this: \"If a general is always confident that his orders will be carried out,\" etc.\"]\n\nthe gain will be mutual.\n\n[Chang Yu says: \"The general has confidence in the men under his command, and the men are docile, having confidence in him. Thus the gain is mutual.\" He quotes a pregnant sentence from Wei Liao Tzŭ, ch. 4: \"The art of giving orders is not to try to rectify minor blunders and not to be swayed by petty doubts.\" Vacillation and fussiness are the surest means of sapping the confidence of an army.]\n\n[1] \"Aids to Scouting,\" p. 26.",
    "## Chapter X. TERRAIN\n\n[Only about a third of the chapter, comprising §§ 1-13, deals with \"terrain,\" the subject being more fully treated in ch. XI. The \"six calamities\" are discussed in §§ 14-20, and the rest of the chapter is again a mere string of desultory remarks, though not less interesting, perhaps, on that account.]",
    "1\\. Sun Tzŭ said: We may distinguish six kinds of terrain, to wit: (1) Accessible ground;\n\n[Mei Yao-ch’en says: \"plentifully provided with roads and means of communications.\"]\n\n(2) entangling ground;\n\n[The same commentator says: \"Net-like country, venturing into which you become entangled.\"]\n\n(3) temporising ground;\n\n[Ground which allows you to \"stave off\" or \"delay.\"]\n\n(4) narrow passes; (5) precipitous heights; (6) positions at a great distance from the enemy.\n\n[It is hardly necessary to point out the faultiness of this classification. A strange lack of logical perception is shown in the Chinaman’s unquestioning acceptance of glaring cross-divisions such as the above.]\n\n2\\. Ground which can be freely traversed by both sides is called _accessible_.",
    "## Chapter X. TERRAIN\n\n3\\. With regard to ground of this nature, be before the enemy in occupying the raised and sunny spots, and carefully guard your line of supplies.\n\n[The general meaning of the last phrase is doubtlessly, as Tu Yu says, \"not to allow the enemy to cut your communications.\" In view of Napoleon’s dictum, \"the secret of war lies in the communications,\" [1] we could wish that Sun Tzŭ had done more than skirt the edge of this important subject here and in I. § 10, VII. § 11. Col. Henderson says: \"The line of supply may be said to be as vital to the existence of an army as the heart to the life of a human being. Just as the duelist who finds his adversary’s point menacing him with certain death, and his own guard astray, is compelled to conform to his adversary’s movements, and to content himself with warding off his thrusts, so the commander whose communications are suddenly threatened finds himself in a false position, and he will be fortunate if he has not to change all his plans, to split up his force into more or less isolated detachments, and to fight with inferior numbers on ground which he has not had time to prepare, and where defeat will not be an ordinary failure, but will entail the ruin or surrender of his whole army.\" [2]\n\nThen you will be able to fight with advantage.\n\n4\\. Ground which can be abandoned but is hard to re-occupy is called _entangling_.",
    "## Chapter X. TERRAIN\n\n5\\. From a position of this sort, if the enemy is unprepared, you may sally forth and defeat him. But if the enemy is prepared for your coming, and you fail to defeat him, then, return being impossible, disaster will ensue.\n\n6\\. When the position is such that neither side will gain by making the first move, it is called _temporising_ ground.\n\n[Tu Mu says: \"Each side finds it inconvenient to move, and the situation remains at a deadlock.\"]\n\n7\\. In a position of this sort, even though the enemy should offer us an attractive bait,\n\n[Tu Yu says, \"turning their backs on us and pretending to flee.\" But this is only one of the lures which might induce us to quit our position.]\n\nit will be advisable not to stir forth, but rather to retreat, thus enticing the enemy in his turn; then, when part of his army has come out, we may deliver our attack with advantage.\n\n8\\. With regard to _narrow passes_, if you can occupy them first, let them be strongly garrisoned and await the advent of the enemy.\n\n[Because then, as Tu Yu observes, \"the initiative will lie with us, and by making sudden and unexpected attacks we shall have the enemy at our mercy.\"]\n\n9\\. Should the enemy forestall you in occupying a pass, do not go after him if the pass is fully garrisoned, but only if it is weakly garrisoned.",
    "## Chapter X. TERRAIN\n\n10\\. With regard to _precipitous heights_, if you are beforehand with your adversary, you should occupy the raised and sunny spots, and there wait for him to come up.",
    "## Chapter X. TERRAIN\n\n[Ts’ao Kung says: \"The particular advantage of securing heights and defiles is that your actions cannot then be dictated by the enemy.\" [For the enunciation of the grand principle alluded to, see VI. § 2]. Chang Yu tells the following anecdote of P’ei Hsing-chien (A.D. 619-682), who was sent on a punitive expedition against the Turkic tribes. \"At night he pitched his camp as usual, and it had already been completely fortified by wall and ditch, when suddenly he gave orders that the army should shift its quarters to a hill near by. This was highly displeasing to his officers, who protested loudly against the extra fatigue which it would entail on the men. P’ei Hsing-chien, however, paid no heed to their remonstrances and had the camp moved as quickly as possible. The same night, a terrific storm came on, which flooded their former place of encampment to the depth of over twelve feet. The recalcitrant officers were amazed at the sight, and owned that they had been in the wrong. ‘How did you know what was going to happen?’ they asked. P’ei Hsing-chien replied: ‘From this time forward be content to obey orders without asking unnecessary questions.’ From this it may be seen,\" Chang Yu continues, \"that high and sunny places are advantageous not only for fighting, but also because they are immune from disastrous floods.\"]",
    "## Chapter X. TERRAIN\n\n11\\. If the enemy has occupied them before you, do not follow him, but retreat and try to entice him away.\n\n[The turning point of Li Shih-min’s campaign in 621 A.D. against the two rebels, Tou Chien-te, King of Hsia, and Wang Shih-ch’ung, Prince of Cheng, was his seizure of the heights of Wu-lao, in spite of which Tou Chien-te persisted in his attempt to relieve his ally in Lo-yang, was defeated and taken prisoner. See _Chiu T’ang Shu_, ch. 2, fol. 5 verso, and also ch. 54.]\n\n12\\. If you are situated at a great distance from the enemy, and the strength of the two armies is equal, it is not easy to provoke a battle,\n\n[The point is that we must not think of undertaking a long and wearisome march, at the end of which, as Tu Yu says, \"we should be exhausted and our adversary fresh and keen.\"]\n\nand fighting will be to your disadvantage.\n\n13\\. These six are the principles connected with Earth.\n\n[Or perhaps, \"the principles relating to ground.\" See, however, I. § 8.]\n\nThe general who has attained a responsible post must be careful to study them.\n\n14\\. Now an army is exposed to six several calamities, not arising from natural causes, but from faults for which the general is responsible. These are: (1) Flight; (2) insubordination; (3) collapse; (4) ruin; (5) disorganisation; (6) rout.\n\n15\\. Other conditions being equal, if one force is hurled against another ten times its size, the result will be the _flight_ of the former.",
    "## Chapter X. TERRAIN\n\n16\\. When the common soldiers are too strong and their officers too weak, the result is _insubordination_.\n\n[Tu Mu cites the unhappy case of T’ien Pu [_Hsin T’ang Shu_, ch. 148], who was sent to Wei in 821 A.D. with orders to lead an army against Wang T’ing-ts’ou. But the whole time he was in command, his soldiers treated him with the utmost contempt, and openly flouted his authority by riding about the camp on donkeys, several thousands at a time. T’ien Pu was powerless to put a stop to this conduct, and when, after some months had passed, he made an attempt to engage the enemy, his troops turned tail and dispersed in every direction. After that, the unfortunate man committed suicide by cutting his throat.]\n\nWhen the officers are too strong and the common soldiers too weak, the result is _collapse_.\n\n[Ts’ao Kung says: \"The officers are energetic and want to press on, the common soldiers are feeble and suddenly collapse.\"]\n\n17\\. When the higher officers are angry and insubordinate, and on meeting the enemy give battle on their own account from a feeling of resentment, before the commander-in-chief can tell whether or no he is in a position to fight, the result is _ruin_.\n\n[Wang Hsi’s note is: \"This means, the general is angry without cause, and at the same time does not appreciate the ability of his subordinate officers; thus he arouses fierce resentment and brings an avalanche of ruin upon his head.\"]",
    "## Chapter X. TERRAIN\n\n18\\. When the general is weak and without authority; when his orders are not clear and distinct;\n\n[Wei Liao Tzŭ (ch. 4) says: \"If the commander gives his orders with decision, the soldiers will not wait to hear them twice; if his moves are made without vacillation, the soldiers will not be in two minds about doing their duty.\" General Baden-Powell says, italicizing the words: \"The secret of getting successful work out of your trained men lies in one nutshell—in the clearness of the instructions they receive.\" [3] Cf. also Wu Tzŭ ch. 3: \"the most fatal defect in a military leader is difference; the worst calamities that befall an army arise from hesitation.\"]\n\nwhen there are no fixed duties assigned to officers and men,\n\n[Tu Mu says: \"Neither officers nor men have any regular routine.\"]\n\nand the ranks are formed in a slovenly haphazard manner, the result is utter _disorganisation_.",
    "## Chapter X. TERRAIN\n\n19\\. When a general, unable to estimate the enemy’s strength, allows an inferior force to engage a larger one, or hurls a weak detachment against a powerful one, and neglects to place picked soldiers in the front rank, the result must be a _rout_.\n\n[Chang Yu paraphrases the latter part of the sentence and continues: \"Whenever there is fighting to be done, the keenest spirits should be appointed to serve in the front ranks, both in order to strengthen the resolution of our own men and to demoralize the enemy.\" Cf. the primi ordines of Caesar (\"De Bello Gallico,\" V. 28, 44, et al.).]\n\n20\\. These are six ways of courting defeat, which must be carefully noted by the general who has attained a responsible post.\n\n[See _supra_, § 13.]\n\n21\\. The natural formation of the country is the soldier’s best ally;\n\n[Ch’en Hao says: \"The advantages of weather and season are not equal to those connected with ground.\"]\n\nbut a power of estimating the adversary, of controlling the forces of victory, and of shrewdly calculating difficulties, dangers and distances, constitutes the test of a great general.\n\n22\\. He who knows these things, and in fighting puts his knowledge into practice, will win his battles. He who knows them not, nor practises them, will surely be defeated.",
    "## Chapter X. TERRAIN\n\n23\\. If fighting is sure to result in victory, then you must fight, even though the ruler forbid it; if fighting will not result in victory, then you must not fight even at the ruler’s bidding.\n\n[Cf. VIII. § 3 fin. Huang Shih-kung of the Ch’in dynasty, who is said to have been the patron of Chang Liang and to have written the _San Lueh_, has these words attributed to him: \"The responsibility of setting an army in motion must devolve on the general alone; if advance and retreat are controlled from the Palace, brilliant results will hardly be achieved. Hence the god-like ruler and the enlightened monarch are content to play a humble part in furthering their country’s cause [lit., kneel down to push the chariot wheel].\" This means that \"in matters lying outside the zenana, the decision of the military commander must be absolute.\" Chang Yu also quote the saying: \"Decrees from the Son of Heaven do not penetrate the walls of a camp.\"]\n\n24\\. The general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without fearing disgrace,\n\n[It was Wellington, I think, who said that the hardest thing of all for a soldier is to retreat.]\n\nwhose only thought is to protect his country and do good service for his sovereign, is the jewel of the kingdom.\n\n[A noble presentiment, in few words, of the Chinese \"happy warrior.\" Such a man, says Ho Shih, \"even if he had to suffer punishment, would not regret his conduct.\"]",
    "## Chapter X. TERRAIN\n\n25\\. Regard your soldiers as your children, and they will follow you into the deepest valleys; look on them as your own beloved sons, and they will stand by you even unto death.",
    "## Chapter X. TERRAIN\n\n[Cf. I. § 6. In this connection, Tu Mu draws for us an engaging picture of the famous general Wu Ch’i, from whose treatise on war I have frequently had occasion to quote: \"He wore the same clothes and ate the same food as the meanest of his soldiers, refused to have either a horse to ride or a mat to sleep on, carried his own surplus rations wrapped in a parcel, and shared every hardship with his men. One of his soldiers was suffering from an abscess, and Wu Ch’i himself sucked out the virus. The soldier’s mother, hearing this, began wailing and lamenting. Somebody asked her, saying: ‘Why do you cry? Your son is only a common soldier, and yet the commander-in-chief himself has sucked the poison from his sore.’ The woman replied, ‘Many years ago, Lord Wu performed a similar service for my husband, who never left him afterwards, and finally met his death at the hands of the enemy. And now that he has done the same for my son, he too will fall fighting I know not where.’\" Li Ch’uan mentions the Viscount of Ch’u, who invaded the small state of Hsiao during the winter. The Duke of Shen said to him: \"Many of the soldiers are suffering severely from the cold.\" So he made a round of the whole army, comforting and encouraging the men; and straightway they felt as if they were clothed in garments lined with floss silk.]",
    "## Chapter X. TERRAIN\n\n26\\. If, however, you are indulgent, but unable to make your authority felt; kind-hearted, but unable to enforce your commands; and incapable, moreover, of quelling disorder: then your soldiers must be likened to spoilt children; they are useless for any practical purpose.\n\n[Li Ching once said that if you could make your soldiers afraid of you, they would not be afraid of the enemy. Tu Mu recalls an instance of stern military discipline which occurred in 219 A.D., when Lu Meng was occupying the town of Chiang-ling. He had given stringent orders to his army not to molest the inhabitants nor take anything from them by force. Nevertheless, a certain officer serving under his banner, who happened to be a fellow-townsman, ventured to appropriate a bamboo hat belonging to one of the people, in order to wear it over his regulation helmet as a protection against the rain. Lu Meng considered that the fact of his being also a native of Ju-nan should not be allowed to palliate a clear breach of discipline, and accordingly he ordered his summary execution, the tears rolling down his face, however, as he did so. This act of severity filled the army with wholesome awe, and from that time forth even articles dropped in the highway were not picked up.]",
    "## Chapter X. TERRAIN\n\n27\\. If we know that our own men are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the enemy is not open to attack, we have gone only halfway towards victory.\n\n[That is, Ts’ao Kung says, \"the issue in this case is uncertain.\"]\n\n28\\. If we know that the enemy is open to attack, but are unaware that our own men are not in a condition to attack, we have gone only halfway towards victory.\n\n[Cf. III. § 13 (1).]\n\n29\\. If we know that the enemy is open to attack, and also know that our men are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the nature of the ground makes fighting impracticable, we have still gone only halfway towards victory.\n\n30\\. Hence the experienced soldier, once in motion, is never bewildered; once he has broken camp, he is never at a loss.\n\n[The reason being, according to Tu Mu, that he has taken his measures so thoroughly as to ensure victory beforehand. \"He does not move recklessly,\" says Chang Yu, \"so that when he does move, he makes no mistakes.\"]\n\n31\\. Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, your victory will not stand in doubt; if you know Heaven and know Earth, you may make your victory complete.\n\n[Li Ch’uan sums up as follows: \"Given a knowledge of three things—the affairs of men, the seasons of heaven and the natural advantages of earth—, victory will invariably crown your battles.\"]\n\n[1] See \"Pensees de Napoleon 1er,\" no. 47.\n\n[2] \"The Science of War,\" chap. 2.\n\n[3] \"Aids to Scouting,\" p. xii.",
    "## Chapter XI. THE NINE SITUATIONS",
    "1\\. Sun Tzŭ said: The art of war recognises nine varieties of ground: (1) Dispersive ground; (2) facile ground; (3) contentious ground; (4) open ground; (5) ground of intersecting highways; (6) serious ground; (7) difficult ground; (8) hemmed-in ground; (9) desperate ground.\n\n2\\. When a chieftain is fighting in his own territory, it is dispersive ground.\n\n[So called because the soldiers, being near to their homes and anxious to see their wives and children, are likely to seize the opportunity afforded by a battle and scatter in every direction. \"In their advance,\" observes Tu Mu, \"they will lack the valor of desperation, and when they retreat, they will find harbors of refuge.\"]\n\n3\\. When he has penetrated into hostile territory, but to no great distance, it is facile ground.\n\n[Li Ch’uan and Ho Shih say \"because of the facility for retreating,\" and the other commentators give similar explanations. Tu Mu remarks: \"When your army has crossed the border, you should burn your boats and bridges, in order to make it clear to everybody that you have no hankering after home.\"]",
    "## Chapter XI. THE NINE SITUATIONS\n\n4\\. Ground the possession of which imports great advantage to either side, is contentious ground.",
    "## Chapter XI. THE NINE SITUATIONS\n\n[Tu Mu defines the ground as ground \"to be contended for.\" Ts’ao Kung says: \"ground on which the few and the weak can defeat the many and the strong,\" such as \"the neck of a pass,\" instanced by Li Ch’uan. Thus, Thermopylae was of this classification because the possession of it, even for a few days only, meant holding the entire invading army in check and thus gaining invaluable time. Cf. Wu Tzŭ, ch. V. ad init.: \"For those who have to fight in the ratio of one to ten, there is nothing better than a narrow pass.\" When Lu Kuang was returning from his triumphant expedition to Turkestan in 385 A.D., and had got as far as I-ho, laden with spoils, Liang Hsi, administrator of Liang-chou, taking advantage of the death of Fu Chien, King of Ch’in, plotted against him and was for barring his way into the province. Yang Han, governor of Kao-ch’ang, counseled him, saying: \"Lu Kuang is fresh from his victories in the west, and his soldiers are vigorous and mettlesome. If we oppose him in the shifting sands of the desert, we shall be no match for him, and we must therefore try a different plan. Let us hasten to occupy the defile at the mouth of the Kao-wu pass, thus cutting him off from supplies of water, and when his troops are prostrated with thirst, we can dictate our own terms without moving. Or if you think that the pass I mention is too far off, we could make a stand against him at the I-wu pass, which is nearer. The cunning and resource of Tzŭ-fang himself would be expended in vain against the enormous strength of these two positions.\" Liang Hsi, refusing to act on this advice, was overwhelmed and swept away by the invader.]",
    "## Chapter XI. THE NINE SITUATIONS\n\n5\\. Ground on which each side has liberty of movement is open ground.\n\n[There are various interpretations of the Chinese adjective for this type of ground. Ts’ao Kung says it means \"ground covered with a network of roads,\" like a chessboard. Ho Shih suggested: \"ground on which intercommunication is easy.\"]\n\n6\\. Ground which forms the key to three contiguous states,\n\n[Ts’au Kung defines this as: \"Our country adjoining the enemy’s and a third country conterminous with both.\" Meng Shih instances the small principality of Cheng, which was bounded on the north-east by Ch’i, on the west by Chin, and on the south by Ch’u.]\n\nso that he who occupies it first has most of the Empire at his command,\n\n[The belligerent who holds this dominating position can constrain most of them to become his allies.]\n\nis ground of intersecting highways.\n\n7\\. When an army has penetrated into the heart of a hostile country, leaving a number of fortified cities in its rear, it is serious ground.\n\n[Wang Hsi explains the name by saying that \"when an army has reached such a point, its situation is serious.\"]\n\n8\\. Mountain forests,\n\n[Or simply \"forests.\"]\n\nrugged steeps, marshes and fens—all country that is hard to traverse: this is difficult ground.\n\n9\\. Ground which is reached through narrow gorges, and from which we can only retire by tortuous paths, so that a small number of the enemy would suffice to crush a large body of our men: this is hemmed in ground.",
    "## Chapter XI. THE NINE SITUATIONS\n\n10\\. Ground on which we can only be saved from destruction by fighting without delay, is desperate ground.",
    "## Chapter XI. THE NINE SITUATIONS\n\n[The situation, as pictured by Ts’ao Kung, is very similar to the \"hemmed-in ground\" except that here escape is no longer possible: \"A lofty mountain in front, a large river behind, advance impossible, retreat blocked.\" Ch’en Hao says: \"to be on ‘desperate ground’ is like sitting in a leaking boat or crouching in a burning house.\" Tu Mu quotes from Li Ching a vivid description of the plight of an army thus entrapped: \"Suppose an army invading hostile territory without the aid of local guides:—it falls into a fatal snare and is at the enemy’s mercy. A ravine on the left, a mountain on the right, a pathway so perilous that the horses have to be roped together and the chariots carried in slings, no passage open in front, retreat cut off behind, no choice but to proceed in single file. Then, before there is time to range our soldiers in order of battle, the enemy is overwhelming strength suddenly appears on the scene. Advancing, we can nowhere take a breathing-space; retreating, we have no haven of refuge. We seek a pitched battle, but in vain; yet standing on the defensive, none of us has a moment’s respite. If we simply maintain our ground, whole days and months will crawl by; the moment we make a move, we have to sustain the enemy’s attacks on front and rear. The country is wild, destitute of water and plants; the army is lacking in the necessaries of life, the horses are jaded and the men worn-out, all the resources of strength and skill unavailing, the pass so narrow that a single man defending it can check the onset of ten thousand; all means of offense in the hands of the enemy, all points of vantage already forfeited by ourselves:—in this terrible plight, even though we had the most valiant soldiers and the keenest of weapons, how could they be employed with the slightest effect?\" Students of Greek history may be reminded of the awful close to the Sicilian expedition, and the agony of the Athenians under Nicias and Demonsthenes. [See Thucydides, VII. 78 sqq.].]",
    "## Chapter XI. THE NINE SITUATIONS\n\n11\\. On dispersive ground, therefore, fight not. On facile ground, halt not. On contentious ground, attack not.\n\n[But rather let all your energies be bent on occupying the advantageous position first. So Ts’ao Kung. Li Ch’uan and others, however, suppose the meaning to be that the enemy has already forestalled us, sot that it would be sheer madness to attack. In the _Sun Tzŭ Hsu Lu_, when the King of Wu inquires what should be done in this case, Sun Tzŭ replies: \"The rule with regard to contentious ground is that those in possession have the advantage over the other side. If a position of this kind is secured first by the enemy, beware of attacking him. Lure him away by pretending to flee—show your banners and sound your drums—make a dash for other places that he cannot afford to lose—trail brushwood and raise a dust—confound his ears and eyes—detach a body of your best troops, and place it secretly in ambuscade. Then your opponent will sally forth to the rescue.\"]",
    "## Chapter XI. THE NINE SITUATIONS\n\n12\\. On open ground, do not try to block the enemy’s way.\n\n[Because the attempt would be futile, and would expose the blocking force itself to serious risks. There are two interpretations available here. I follow that of Chang Yu. The other is indicated in Ts’ao Kung’s brief note: \"Draw closer together\"—i.e., see that a portion of your own army is not cut off.]\n\nOn ground of intersecting highways, join hands with your allies.\n\n[Or perhaps, \"form alliances with neighbouring states.\"]",
    "## Chapter XI. THE NINE SITUATIONS\n\n13\\. On serious ground, gather in plunder.\n\n[On this, Li Ch’uan has the following delicious note: \"When an army penetrates far into the enemy’s country, care must be taken not to alienate the people by unjust treatment. Follow the example of the Han Emperor Kao Tsu, whose march into Ch’in territory was marked by no violation of women or looting of valuables. [Nota bene: this was in 207 B.C., and may well cause us to blush for the Christian armies that entered Peking in 1900 A.D.] Thus he won the hearts of all. In the present passage, then, I think that the true reading must be, not ‘plunder,’ but ‘do not plunder.’\" Alas, I fear that in this instance the worthy commentator’s feelings outran his judgment. Tu Mu, at least, has no such illusions. He says: \"When encamped on ‘serious ground,’ there being no inducement as yet to advance further, and no possibility of retreat, one ought to take measures for a protracted resistance by bringing in provisions from all sides, and keep a close watch on the enemy.\"]\n\nIn difficult ground, keep steadily on the march.\n\n[Or, in the words of VIII. § 2, \"do not encamp.]",
    "## Chapter XI. THE NINE SITUATIONS\n\n14\\. On hemmed-in ground, resort to stratagem.\n\n[Ts’au Kung says: \"Try the effect of some unusual artifice;\" and Tu Yu amplifies this by saying: \"In such a position, some scheme must be devised which will suit the circumstances, and if we can succeed in deluding the enemy, the peril may be escaped.\" This is exactly what happened on the famous occasion when Hannibal was hemmed in among the mountains on the road to Casilinum, and to all appearances entrapped by the dictator Fabius. The stratagem which Hannibal devised to baffle his foes was remarkably like that which T’ien Tan had also employed with success exactly 62 years before. [See IX. § 24, note.] When night came on, bundles of twigs were fastened to the horns of some 2000 oxen and set on fire, the terrified animals being then quickly driven along the mountain side towards the passes which were beset by the enemy. The strange spectacle of these rapidly moving lights so alarmed and discomfited the Romans that they withdrew from their position, and Hannibal’s army passed safely through the defile. [See Polybius, III. 93, 94; Livy, XXII. 16 17.]\n\nOn desperate ground, fight.\n\n[For, as Chia Lin remarks: \"if you fight with all your might, there is a chance of life; where as death is certain if you cling to your corner.\"]",
    "## Chapter XI. THE NINE SITUATIONS\n\n15\\. Those who were called skilful leaders of old knew how to drive a wedge between the enemy’s front and rear;\n\n[More literally, \"cause the front and rear to lose touch with each other.\"]\n\nto prevent co-operation between his large and small divisions; to hinder the good troops from rescuing the bad, the officers from rallying their men.\n\n16\\. When the enemy’s men were scattered, they prevented them from concentrating; even when their forces were united, they managed to keep them in disorder.\n\n17\\. When it was to their advantage, they made a forward move; when otherwise, they stopped still.\n\n[Mei Yao-ch’en connects this with the foregoing: \"Having succeeded in thus dislocating the enemy, they would push forward in order to secure any advantage to be gained; if there was no advantage to be gained, they would remain where they were.\"]",
    "## Chapter XI. THE NINE SITUATIONS\n\n18\\. If asked how to cope with a great host of the enemy in orderly array and on the point of marching to the attack, I should say: \"Begin by seizing something which your opponent holds dear; then he will be amenable to your will.\"\n\n[Opinions differ as to what Sun Tzŭ had in mind. Ts’ao Kung thinks it is \"some strategical advantage on which the enemy is depending.\" Tu Mu says: \"The three things which an enemy is anxious to do, and on the accomplishment of which his success depends, are: (1) to capture our favourable positions; (2) to ravage our cultivated land; (3) to guard his own communications.\" Our object then must be to thwart his plans in these three directions and thus render him helpless. [Cf. III. § 3.] By boldly seizing the initiative in this way, you at once throw the other side on the defensive.]",
    "## Chapter XI. THE NINE SITUATIONS\n\n19\\. Rapidity is the essence of war:",
    "## Chapter XI. THE NINE SITUATIONS\n\n[According to Tu Mu, \"this is a summary of leading principles in warfare,\" and he adds: \"These are the profoundest truths of military science, and the chief business of the general.\" The following anecdotes, told by Ho Shih, shows the importance attached to speed by two of China’s greatest generals. In 227 A.D., Meng Ta, governor of Hsin-ch’eng under the Wei Emperor Wen Ti, was meditating defection to the House of Shu, and had entered into correspondence with Chu-ko Liang, Prime Minister of that State. The Wei general Ssu-ma I was then military governor of Wan, and getting wind of Meng Ta’s treachery, he at once set off with an army to anticipate his revolt, having previously cajoled him by a specious message of friendly import. Ssu-ma’s officers came to him and said: \"If Meng Ta has leagued himself with Wu and Shu, the matter should be thoroughly investigated before we make a move.\" Ssu-ma I replied: \"Meng Ta is an unprincipled man, and we ought to go and punish him at once, while he is still wavering and before he has thrown off the mask.\" Then, by a series of forced marches, be brought his army under the walls of Hsin-ch’eng with in a space of eight days. Now Meng Ta had previously said in a letter to Chu-ko Liang: \"Wan is 1200 _li_ from here. When the news of my revolt reaches Ssu-ma I, he will at once inform his imperial master, but it will be a whole month before any steps can be taken, and by that time my city will be well fortified. Besides, Ssu-ma I is sure not to come himself, and the generals that will be sent against us are not worth troubling about.\" The next letter, however, was filled with consternation: \"Though only eight days have passed since I threw off my allegiance, an army is already at the city-gates. What miraculous rapidity is this!\" A fortnight later, Hsin- ch’eng had fallen and Meng Ta had lost his head. [See _Chin Shu_, ch. 1, f. 3.] In 621 A.D., Li Ching was sent from K’uei-chou in Ssu-ch’uan to reduce the successful rebel Hsiao Hsien, who had set up as Emperor at the modern Ching-chou Fu in Hupeh. It was autumn, and the Yangtsze being then in flood, Hsiao Hsien never dreamt that his adversary would venture to come down through the gorges, and consequently made no preparations. But Li Ching embarked his army without loss of time, and was just about to start when the other generals implored him to postpone his departure until the river was in a less dangerous state for navigation. Li Ching replied: \"To the soldier, overwhelming speed is of paramount importance, and he must never miss opportunities. Now is the time to strike, before Hsiao Hsien even knows that we have got an army together. If we seize the present moment when the river is in flood, we shall appear before his capital with startling suddenness, like the thunder which is heard before you have time to stop your ears against it. [See VII. § 19, note.] This is the great principle in war. Even if he gets to know of our approach, he will have to levy his soldiers in such a hurry that they will not be fit to oppose us. Thus the full fruits of victory will be ours.\" All came about as he predicted, and Hsiao Hsien was obliged to surrender, nobly stipulating that his people should be spared and he alone suffer the penalty of death.]",

    "## Chapter XI. THE NINE SITUATIONS\n\n[Ch’en recalls the line of action adopted in 224 B.C. by the famous general Wang Chien, whose military genius largely contributed to the success of the First Emperor. He had invaded the Ch’u State, where a universal levy was made to oppose him. But, being doubtful of the temper of his troops, he declined all invitations to fight and remained strictly on the defensive. In vain did the Ch’u general try to force a battle: day after day Wang Chien kept inside his walls and would not come out, but devoted his whole time and energy to winning the affection and confidence of his men. He took care that they should be well fed, sharing his own meals with them, provided facilities for bathing, and employed every method of judicious indulgence to weld them into a loyal and homogenous body. After some time had elapsed, he told off certain persons to find out how the men were amusing themselves. The answer was, that they were contending with one another in putting the weight and long-jumping. When Wang Chien heard that they were engaged in these athletic pursuits, he knew that their spirits had been strung up to the required pitch and that they were now ready for fighting. By this time the Ch’u army, after repeating their challenge again and again, had marched away eastwards in disgust. The Ch’in general immediately broke up his camp and followed them, and in the battle that ensued they were routed with great slaughter. Shortly afterwards, the whole of Ch’u was conquered by Ch’in, and the king Fu-ch’u led into captivity.]",
    "## Chapter XI. THE NINE SITUATIONS\n\nKeep your army continually on the move,\n\n[In order that the enemy may never know exactly where you are. It has struck me, however, that the true reading might be \"link your army together.\"]\n\nand devise unfathomable plans.",
    "## Chapter XI. THE NINE SITUATIONS\n\n23\\. Throw your soldiers into positions whence there is no escape, and they will prefer death to flight. If they will face death, there is nothing they may not achieve.\n\n[Chang Yu quotes his favourite Wei Liao Tzŭ (ch. 3): \"If one man were to run amok with a sword in the market-place, and everybody else tried to get our of his way, I should not allow that this man alone had courage and that all the rest were contemptible cowards. The truth is, that a desperado and a man who sets some value on his life do not meet on even terms.\"]\n\nOfficers and men alike will put forth their uttermost strength.\n\n[Chang Yu says: \"If they are in an awkward place together, they will surely exert their united strength to get out of it.\"]\n\n24\\. Soldiers when in desperate straits lose the sense of fear. If there is no place of refuge, they will stand firm. If they are in the heart of a hostile country, they will show a stubborn front. If there is no help for it, they will fight hard.\n\n25\\. Thus, without waiting to be marshalled, the soldiers will be constantly on the _qui vive;_ without waiting to be asked, they will do your will;\n\n[Literally, \"without asking, you will get.\"]\n\nwithout restrictions, they will be faithful; without giving orders, they can be trusted.",
    "## Chapter XI. THE NINE SITUATIONS\n\n26\\. Prohibit the taking of omens, and do away with superstitious doubts. Then, until death itself comes, no calamity need be feared.\n\n[The superstitious, \"bound in to saucy doubts and fears,\" degenerate into cowards and \"die many times before their deaths.\" Tu Mu quotes Huang Shih-kung: \"‘Spells and incantations should be strictly forbidden, and no officer allowed to inquire by divination into the fortunes of an army, for fear the soldiers’ minds should be seriously perturbed.’ The meaning is,\" he continues, \"that if all doubts and scruples are discarded, your men will never falter in their resolution until they die.\"]\n\n27\\. If our soldiers are not overburdened with money, it is not because they have a distaste for riches; if their lives are not unduly long, it is not because they are disinclined to longevity.\n\n[Chang Yu has the best note on this passage: \"Wealth and long life are things for which all men have a natural inclination. Hence, if they burn or fling away valuables, and sacrifice their own lives, it is not that they dislike them, but simply that they have no choice.\" Sun Tzŭ is slyly insinuating that, as soldiers are but human, it is for the general to see that temptations to shirk fighting and grow rich are not thrown in their way.]",
    "## Chapter XI. THE NINE SITUATIONS\n\n28\\. On the day they are ordered out to battle, your soldiers may weep,\n\n[The word in the Chinese is \"snivel.\" This is taken to indicate more genuine grief than tears alone.]\n\nthose sitting up bedewing their garments, and those lying down letting the tears run down their cheeks.\n\n[Not because they are afraid, but because, as Ts’ao Kung says, \"all have embraced the firm resolution to do or die.\" We may remember that the heroes of the Iliad were equally childlike in showing their emotion. Chang Yu alludes to the mournful parting at the I River between Ching K’o and his friends, when the former was sent to attempt the life of the King of Ch’in (afterwards First Emperor) in 227 B.C. The tears of all flowed down like rain as he bade them farewell and uttered the following lines: \"The shrill blast is blowing, Chilly the burn; Your champion is going—Not to return.\" [1] ]\n\nBut let them once be brought to bay, and they will display the courage of a Chu or a Kuei.",
    "## Chapter XI. THE NINE SITUATIONS\n\n[Chu was the personal name of Chuan Chu, a native of the Wu State and contemporary with Sun Tzŭ himself, who was employed by Kung-tzu Kuang, better known as Ho Lu Wang, to assassinate his sovereign Wang Liao with a dagger which he secreted in the belly of a fish served up at a banquet. He succeeded in his attempt, but was immediately hacked to pieces by the king’s bodyguard. This was in 515 B.C. The other hero referred to, Ts’ao Kuei (or Ts’ao Mo), performed the exploit which has made his name famous 166 years earlier, in 681 B.C. Lu had been thrice defeated by Ch’i, and was just about to conclude a treaty surrendering a large slice of territory, when Ts’ao Kuei suddenly seized Huan Kung, the Duke of Ch’i, as he stood on the altar steps and held a dagger against his chest. None of the duke’s retainers dared to move a muscle, and Ts’ao Kuei proceeded to demand full restitution, declaring the Lu was being unjustly treated because she was a smaller and a weaker state. Huan Kung, in peril of his life, was obliged to consent, whereupon Ts’ao Kuei flung away his dagger and quietly resumed his place amid the terrified assemblage without having so much as changed color. As was to be expected, the Duke wanted afterwards to repudiate the bargain, but his wise old counselor Kuan Chung pointed out to him the impolicy of breaking his word, and the upshot was that this bold stroke regained for Lu the whole of what she had lost in three pitched battles.]",

Now the _shuai-jan_ is a snake that is found in the Ch‘ang mountains.\n\n[\"_Shuai-jan_\" means \"suddenly\" or \"rapidly,\" and the snake in question was doubtless so called owing to the rapidity of its movements. Through this passage, the term in the Chinese has now come to be used in the sense of \"military manœuvers.\"]\n\nStrike at its head, and you will be attacked by its tail; strike at its tail, and you will be attacked by its head; strike at its middle, and you will be attacked by head and tail both.\n\n30\\. Asked if an army can be made to imitate the _shuai-jan_,\n\n[That is, as Mei Yao-ch’en says, \"Is it possible to make the front and rear of an army each swiftly responsive to attack on the other, just as though they were part of a single living body?\"]\n\nI should answer, Yes. For the men of Wu and the men of Yüeh are enemies;\n\n[Cf. VI. § 21.]\n\nyet if they are crossing a river in the same boat and are caught by a storm, they will come to each other’s assistance just as the left hand helps the right.\n\n[The meaning is: If two enemies will help each other in a time of common peril, how much more should two parts of the same army, bound together as they are by every tie of interest and fellow-feeling. Yet it is notorious that many a campaign has been ruined through lack of cooperation, especially in the case of allied armies.]",
    "## Chapter XI. THE NINE SITUATIONS\n\n31\\. Hence it is not enough to put one’s trust in the tethering of horses, and the burying of chariot wheels in the ground.\n\n[These quaint devices to prevent one’s army from running away recall the Athenian hero Sophanes, who carried the anchor with him at the battle of Plataea, by means of which he fastened himself firmly to one spot. [See Herodotus, IX. 74.] It is not enough, says Sun Tzŭ, to render flight impossible by such mechanical means. You will not succeed unless your men have tenacity and unity of purpose, and, above all, a spirit of sympathetic cooperation. This is the lesson which can be learned from the _shuai-jan_.]\n\n32\\. The principle on which to manage an army is to set up one standard of courage which all must reach.\n\n[Literally, \"level the courage [of all] as though [it were that of] one.\" If the ideal army is to form a single organic whole, then it follows that the resolution and spirit of its component parts must be of the same quality, or at any rate must not fall below a certain standard. Wellington’s seemingly ungrateful description of his army at Waterloo as \"the worst he had ever commanded\" meant no more than that it was deficient in this important particular—unity of spirit and courage. Had he not foreseen the Belgian defections and carefully kept those troops in the background, he would almost certainly have lost the day.]",
    "## Chapter XI. THE NINE SITUATIONS\n\n33\\. How to make the best of both strong and weak—that is a question involving the proper use of ground.\n\n[Mei Yao-ch’en’s paraphrase is: \"The way to eliminate the differences of strong and weak and to make both serviceable is to utilize accidental features of the ground.\" Less reliable troops, if posted in strong positions, will hold out as long as better troops on more exposed terrain. The advantage of position neutralizes the inferiority in stamina and courage. Col. Henderson says: \"With all respect to the text books, and to the ordinary tactical teaching, I am inclined to think that the study of ground is often overlooked, and that by no means sufficient importance is attached to the selection of positions… and to the immense advantages that are to be derived, whether you are defending or attacking, from the proper utilization of natural features.\" [2] ]\n\n34\\. Thus the skilful general conducts his army just as though he were leading a single man, willy-nilly, by the hand.\n\n[Tu Mu says: \"The simile has reference to the ease with which he does it.\"]\n\n35\\. It is the business of a general to be quiet and thus ensure secrecy; upright and just, and thus maintain order.",
    "## Chapter XI. THE NINE SITUATIONS\n\n36\\. He must be able to mystify his officers and men by false reports and appearances,\n\n[Literally, \"to deceive their eyes and ears.\"]\n\nand thus keep them in total ignorance.",
    "## Chapter XI. THE NINE SITUATIONS\n\n[Ts’ao Kung gives us one of his excellent apophthegms: \"The troops must not be allowed to share your schemes in the beginning; they may only rejoice with you over their happy outcome.\" \"To mystify, mislead, and surprise the enemy,\" is one of the first principles in war, as had been frequently pointed out. But how about the other process—the mystification of one’s own men? Those who may think that Sun Tzŭ is over-emphatic on this point would do well to read Col. Henderson’s remarks on Stonewall Jackson’s Valley campaign: \"The infinite pains,\" he says, \"with which Jackson sought to conceal, even from his most trusted staff officers, his movements, his intentions, and his thoughts, a commander less thorough would have pronounced useless\"—etc. etc. [3] In the year 88 A.D., as we read in ch. 47 of the _Hou Han Shu_, \"Pan Ch’ao took the field with 25,000 men from Khotan and other Central Asian states with the object of crushing Yarkand. The King of Kutcha replied by dispatching his chief commander to succour the place with an army drawn from the kingdoms of Wen-su, Ku-mo, and Wei-t’ou, totaling 50,000 men. Pan Ch’ao summoned his officers and also the King of Khotan to a council of war, and said: ‘Our forces are now outnumbered and unable to make head against the enemy. The best plan, then, is for us to separate and disperse, each in a different direction. The King of Khotan will march away by the easterly route, and I will then return myself towards the west. Let us wait until the evening drum has sounded and then start.’ Pan Ch’ao now secretly released the prisoners whom he had taken alive, and the King of Kutcha was thus informed of his plans. Much elated by the news, the latter set off at once at the head of 10,000 horsemen to bar Pan Ch’ao’s retreat in the west, while the King of Wen-su rode eastward with 8000 horse in order to intercept the King of Khotan. As soon as Pan Ch’ao knew that the two chieftains had gone, he called his divisions together, got them well in hand, and at cock-crow hurled them against the army of Yarkand, as it lay encamped. The barbarians, panic-stricken, fled in confusion, and were closely pursued by Pan Ch’ao. Over 5000 heads were brought back as trophies, besides immense spoils in the shape of horses and cattle and valuables of every description. Yarkand then capitulating, Kutcha and the other kingdoms drew off their respective forces. From that time forward, Pan Ch’ao’s prestige completely overawed the countries of the west.\" In this case, we see that the Chinese general not only kept his own officers in ignorance of his real plans, but actually took the bold step of dividing his army in order to deceive the enemy.]",
    "## Chapter XI. THE NINE SITUATIONS\n\n37\\. By altering his arrangements and changing his plans,\n\n[Wang Hsi thinks that this means not using the same stratagem twice.]\n\nhe keeps the enemy without definite knowledge.\n\n[Chang Yu, in a quotation from another work, says: \"The axiom, that war is based on deception, does not apply only to deception of the enemy. You must deceive even your own soldiers. Make them follow you, but without letting them know why.\"]\n\nBy shifting his camp and taking circuitous routes, he prevents the enemy from anticipating his purpose.\n\n38\\. At the critical moment, the leader of an army acts like one who has climbed up a height and then kicks away the ladder behind him. He carries his men deep into hostile territory before he shows his hand.\n\n[Literally, \"releases the spring\" (see V. § 15), that is, takes some decisive step which makes it impossible for the army to return—like Hsiang Yu, who sunk his ships after crossing a river. Ch’en Hao, followed by Chia Lin, understands the words less well as \"puts forth every artifice at his command.\"]\n\n39\\. He burns his boats and breaks his cooking-pots; like a shepherd driving a flock of sheep, he drives his men this way and that, and none knows whither he is going.\n\n[Tu Mu says: \"The army is only cognizant of orders to advance or retreat; it is ignorant of the ulterior ends of attacking and conquering.\"]",
    "## Chapter XI. THE NINE SITUATIONS\n\n40\\. To muster his host and bring it into danger:—this may be termed the business of the general.\n\n[Sun Tzŭ means that after mobilization there should be no delay in aiming a blow at the enemy’s heart. Note how he returns again and again to this point. Among the warring states of ancient China, desertion was no doubt a much more present fear and serious evil than it is in the armies of today.]\n\n41\\. The different measures suited to the nine varieties of ground;\n\n[Chang Yu says: \"One must not be hide-bound in interpreting the rules for the nine varieties of ground.\"]\n\nthe expediency of aggressive or defensive tactics; and the fundamental laws of human nature: these are things that must most certainly be studied.\n\n42\\. When invading hostile territory, the general principle is, that penetrating deeply brings cohesion; penetrating but a short way means dispersion.\n\n[Cf. _supra_, § 20.]",
    "## Chapter XI. THE NINE SITUATIONS\n\n43\\. When you leave your own country behind, and take your army across neighbourhood territory, you find yourself on critical ground.\n\n[This \"ground\" is curiously mentioned in VIII. § 2, but it does not figure among the Nine Situations or the Six Calamities in chap. X. One’s first impulse would be to translate it distant ground,\" but this, if we can trust the commentators, is precisely what is not meant here. Mei Yao-ch’en says it is \"a position not far enough advanced to be called ‘facile,’ and not near enough to home to be ‘dispersive,’ but something between the two.\" Wang Hsi says: \"It is ground separated from home by an interjacent state, whose territory we have had to cross in order to reach it. Hence, it is incumbent on us to settle our business there quickly.\" He adds that this position is of rare occurrence, which is the reason why it is not included among the Nine Situations.]\n\nWhen there are means of communication on all four sides, the ground is one of intersecting highways.\n\n44\\. When you penetrate deeply into a country, it is serious ground. When you penetrate but a little way, it is facile ground.\n\n45\\. When you have the enemy’s strongholds on your rear, and narrow passes in front, it is hemmed-in ground. When there is no place of refuge at all, it is desperate ground.",
    "## Chapter XI. THE NINE SITUATIONS\n\n46\\. Therefore, on dispersive ground, I would inspire my men with unity of purpose.\n\n[This end, according to Tu Mu, is best attained by remaining on the defensive, and avoiding battle. Cf. _supra_, § 11.]\n\nOn facile ground, I would see that there is close connection between all parts of my army.\n\n[As Tu Mu says, the object is to guard against two possible contingencies: \"(1) the desertion of our own troops; (2) a sudden attack on the part of the enemy.\" Cf. VII. § 17. Mei Yao-ch’en says: \"On the march, the regiments should be in close touch; in an encampment, there should be continuity between the fortifications.\"]",
    "## Chapter XI. THE NINE SITUATIONS\n\n47\\. On contentious ground, I would hurry up my rear.\n\n[This is Ts’ao Kung’s interpretation. Chang Yu adopts it, saying: \"We must quickly bring up our rear, so that head and tail may both reach the goal.\" That is, they must not be allowed to straggle up a long way apart. Mei Yao-ch’en offers another equally plausible explanation: \"Supposing the enemy has not yet reached the coveted position, and we are behind him, we should advance with all speed in order to dispute its possession.\" Ch’en Hao, on the other hand, assuming that the enemy has had time to select his own ground, quotes VI. § 1, where Sun Tzŭ warns us against coming exhausted to the attack. His own idea of the situation is rather vaguely expressed: \"If there is a favourable position lying in front of you, detach a picked body of troops to occupy it, then if the enemy, relying on their numbers, come up to make a fight for it, you may fall quickly on their rear with your main body, and victory will be assured.\" It was thus, he adds, that Chao She beat the army of Ch’in. (See p. 57.)]\n\n48\\. On open ground, I would keep a vigilant eye on my defences. On ground of intersecting highways, I would consolidate my alliances.",
    "## Chapter XI. THE NINE SITUATIONS\n\n49\\. On serious ground, I would try to ensure a continuous stream of supplies.\n\n[The commentators take this as referring to forage and plunder, not, as one might expect, to an unbroken communication with a home base.]\n\nOn difficult ground, I would keep pushing on along the road.",
    "## Chapter XI. THE NINE SITUATIONS\n\n50\\. On hemmed-in ground, I would block any way of retreat.\n\n[Meng Shih says: \"To make it seem that I meant to defend the position, whereas my real intention is to burst suddenly through the enemy’s lines.\" Mei Yao-ch’en says: \"in order to make my soldiers fight with desperation.\" Wang Hsi says, \"fearing lest my men be tempted to run away.\" Tu Mu points out that this is the converse of VII. § 36, where it is the enemy who is surrounded. In 532 A.D., Kao Huan, afterwards Emperor and canonized as Shen-wu, was surrounded by a great army under Erh-chu Chao and others. His own force was comparatively small, consisting only of 2000 horse and something under 30,000 foot. The lines of investment had not been drawn very closely together, gaps being left at certain points. But Kao Huan, instead of trying to escape, actually made a shift to block all the remaining outlets himself by driving into them a number of oxen and donkeys roped together. As soon as his officers and men saw that there was nothing for it but to conquer or die, their spirits rose to an extraordinary pitch of exaltation, and they charged with such desperate ferocity that the opposing ranks broke and crumbled under their onslaught.]\n\nOn desperate ground, I would proclaim to my soldiers the hopelessness of saving their lives.",
    "## Chapter XI. THE NINE SITUATIONS\n\nTu Yu says: \"Burn your baggage and impedimenta, throw away your stores and provisions, choke up the wells, destroy your cooking-stoves, and make it plain to your men that they cannot survive, but must fight to the death.\" Mei Yao-ch’en says: \"The only chance of life lies in giving up all hope of it.\" This concludes what Sun Tzŭ has to say about \"grounds\" and the \"variations\" corresponding to them. Reviewing the passages which bear on this important subject, we cannot fail to be struck by the desultory and unmethodical fashion in which it is treated. Sun Tzŭ begins abruptly in VIII. § 2 to enumerate \"variations\" before touching on \"grounds\" at all, but only mentions five, namely nos. 7, 5, 8 and 9 of the subsequent list, and one that is not included in it. A few varieties of ground are dealt with in the earlier portion of chap. IX, and then chap. X sets forth six new grounds, with six variations of plan to match. None of these is mentioned again, though the first is hardly to be distinguished from ground no. 4 in the next chapter. At last, in chap. XI, we come to the Nine Grounds par excellence, immediately followed by the variations. This takes us down to § 14. In §§ 43-45, fresh definitions are provided for nos. 5, 6, 2, 8 and 9 (in the order given), as well as for the tenth ground noticed in chap. VIII; and finally, the nine variations are enumerated once more from beginning to end, all, with the exception of 5, 6 and 7, being different from those previously given. Though it is impossible to account for the present state of Sun Tzŭ’s text, a few suggestive facts maybe brought into prominence: (1) Chap. VIII, according to the title, should deal with nine variations, whereas only five appear. (2) It is an abnormally short chapter. (3) Chap. XI is entitled The Nine Grounds. Several of these are defined twice over, besides which there are two distinct lists of the corresponding variations. (4) The length of the chapter is disproportionate, being double that of any other except IX. I do not propose to draw any inferences from these facts, beyond the general conclusion that Sun Tzŭ’s work cannot have come down to us in the shape in which it left his hands: chap. VIII is obviously defective and probably out of place, while XI seems to contain matter that has either been added by a later hand or ought to appear elsewhere.]",

    "## Chapter XI. THE NINE SITUATIONS\n\n[Chang Yu alludes to the conduct of Pan Ch’ao’s devoted followers in 73 A.D. The story runs thus in the _Hou Han Shu_, ch. 47: \"When Pan Ch’ao arrived at Shan-shan, Kuang, the King of the country, received him at first with great politeness and respect; but shortly afterwards his behavior underwent a sudden change, and he became remiss and negligent. Pan Ch’ao spoke about this to the officers of his suite: ‘Have you noticed,’ he said, ‘that Kuang’s polite intentions are on the wane? This must signify that envoys have come from the Northern barbarians, and that consequently he is in a state of indecision, not knowing with which side to throw in his lot. That surely is the reason. The truly wise man, we are told, can perceive things before they have come to pass; how much more, then, those that are already manifest!’ Thereupon he called one of the natives who had been assigned to his service, and set a trap for him, saying: ‘Where are those envoys from the Hsiung-nu who arrived some day ago?’ The man was so taken aback that between surprise and fear he presently blurted out the whole truth. Pan Ch’ao, keeping his informant carefully under lock and key, then summoned a general gathering of his officers, thirty-six in all, and began drinking with them. When the wine had mounted into their heads a little, he tried to rouse their spirit still further by addressing them thus: ‘Gentlemen, here we are in the heart of an isolated region, anxious to achieve riches and honour by some great exploit. Now it happens that an ambassador from the Hsiung-no arrived in this kingdom only a few days ago, and the result is that the respectful courtesy extended towards us by our royal host has disappeared. Should this envoy prevail upon him to seize our party and hand us over to the Hsiung-no, our bones will become food for the wolves of the desert. What are we to do?’ With one accord, the officers replied: ‘Standing as we do in peril of our lives, we will follow our commander through life and death.’ For the sequel of this adventure, see chap. XII. § 1, note.]",

We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of the country—its mountains and forests, its pitfalls and precipices, its marshes and swamps. We shall be unable to turn natural advantages to account unless we make use of local guides.\n\n[These three sentences are repeated from VII. §§ 12-14—in order to emphasize their importance, the commentators seem to think. I prefer to regard them as interpolated here in order to form an antecedent to the following words. With regard to local guides, Sun Tzŭ might have added that there is always the risk of going wrong, either through their treachery or some misunderstanding such as Livy records (XXII. 13): Hannibal, we are told, ordered a guide to lead him into the neighbourhood of Casinum, where there was an important pass to be occupied; but his Carthaginian accent, unsuited to the pronunciation of Latin names, caused the guide to understand Casilinum instead of Casinum, and turning from his proper route, he took the army in that direction, the mistake not being discovered until they had almost arrived.]\n\n53\\. To be ignorant of any one of the following four or five principles does not befit a warlike prince.",
    "## Chapter XI. THE NINE SITUATIONS\n\n54\\. When a warlike prince attacks a powerful state, his generalship shows itself in preventing the concentration of the enemy’s forces. He overawes his opponents, and their allies are prevented from joining against him.",
    "## Chapter XI. THE NINE SITUATIONS\n\n[Mei Tao-ch’en constructs one of the chains of reasoning that are so much affected by the Chinese: \"In attacking a powerful state, if you can divide her forces, you will have a superiority in strength; if you have a superiority in strength, you will overawe the enemy; if you overawe the enemy, the neighbouring states will be frightened; and if the neighbouring states are frightened, the enemy’s allies will be prevented from joining her.\" The following gives a stronger meaning: \"If the great state has once been defeated (before she has had time to summon her allies), then the lesser states will hold aloof and refrain from massing their forces.\" Ch’en Hao and Chang Yu take the sentence in quite another way. The former says: \"Powerful though a prince may be, if he attacks a large state, he will be unable to raise enough troops, and must rely to some extent on external aid; if he dispenses with this, and with overweening confidence in his own strength, simply tries to intimidate the enemy, he will surely be defeated.\" Chang Yu puts his view thus: \"If we recklessly attack a large state, our own people will be discontented and hang back.

He carries out his own secret designs, keeping his antagonists in awe.\n\n[The train of thought, as said by Li Ch’uan, appears to be this: Secure against a combination of his enemies, \"he can afford to reject entangling alliances and simply pursue his own secret designs, his prestige enable him to dispense with external friendships.\"]\n\nThus he is able to capture their cities and overthrow their kingdoms.\n\n[This paragraph, though written many years before the Ch’in State became a serious menace, is not a bad summary of the policy by which the famous Six Chancellors gradually paved the way for her final triumph under Shih Huang Ti.

    "## Chapter XI. THE NINE SITUATIONS\n\n[These words of Sun Tzŭ were once quoted by Han Hsin in explanation of the tactics he employed in one of his most brilliant battles, already alluded to on p. 28. In 204 B.C., he was sent against the army of Chao, and halted ten miles from the mouth of the Ching-hsing pass, where the enemy had mustered in full force. Here, at midnight, he detached a body of 2000 light cavalry, every man of which was furnished with a red flag. Their instructions were to make their way through narrow defiles and keep a secret watch on the enemy. \"When the men of Chao see me in full flight,\" Han Hsin said, \"they will abandon their fortifications and give chase. This must be the sign for you to rush in, pluck down the Chao standards and set up the red banners of Han in their stead.\" Turning then to his other officers, he remarked: \"Our adversary holds a strong position, and is not likely to come out and attack us until he sees the standard and drums of the commander-in-chief, for fear I should turn back and escape through the mountains.\" So saying, he first of all sent out a division consisting of 10,000 men, and ordered them to form in line of battle with their backs to the River Ti. Seeing this manœuver, the whole army of Chao broke into loud laughter. By this time it was broad daylight, and Han Hsin, displaying the generalissimo’s flag, marched out of the pass with drums beating, and was immediately engaged by the enemy. A great battle followed, lasting for some time; until at length Han Hsin and his colleague Chang Ni, leaving drums and banner on the field, fled to the division on the river bank, where another fierce battle was raging. The enemy rushed out to pursue them and to secure the trophies, thus denuding their ramparts of men; but the two generals succeeded in joining the other army, which was fighting with the utmost desperation. The time had now come for the 2000 horsemen to play their part. As soon as they saw the men of Chao following up their advantage, they galloped behind the deserted walls, tore up the enemy’s flags and replaced them by those of Han. When the Chao army looked back from the pursuit, the sight of these red flags struck them with terror. Convinced that the Hans had got in and overpowered their king, they broke up in wild disorder, every effort of their leader to stay the panic being in vain. Then the Han army fell on them from both sides and completed the rout, killing a number and capturing the rest, amongst whom was King Ya himself…. After the battle, some of Han Hsin’s officers came to him and said: \"In the _Art of War_ we are told to have a hill or tumulus on the right rear, and a river or marsh on the left front. [This appears to be a blend of Sun Tzŭ and T’ai Kung. See IX § 9, and note.] You, on the contrary, ordered us to draw up our troops with the river at our back. Under these conditions, how did you manage to gain the victory?\" The general replied: \"I fear you gentlemen have not studied the Art of War with sufficient care. Is it not written there: ‘Plunge your army into desperate straits and it will come off in safety; place it in deadly peril and it will survive’? Had I taken the usual course, I should never have been able to bring my colleague round. What says the Military Classic—‘Swoop down on the market-place and drive the men off to fight.’ [This passage does not occur in the present text of Sun Tzŭ.] If I had not placed my troops in a position where they were obliged to fight for their lives, but had allowed each man to follow his own discretion, there would have been a general _débandade_, and it would have been impossible to do anything with them.\" The officers admitted the force of his argument, and said: \"These are higher tactics than we should have been capable of.\" [See _Ch’ien Han Shu_, ch. 34, ff. 4, 5.] ]",
    "## Chapter XI. THE NINE SITUATIONS\n\n59\\. For it is precisely when a force has fallen into harm’s way that is capable of striking a blow for victory.\n\n[Danger has a bracing effect.]\n\n60\\. Success in warfare is gained by carefully accommodating ourselves to the enemy’s purpose.\n\n[Ts’ao Kung says: \"Feign stupidity\"—by an appearance of yielding and falling in with the enemy’s wishes. Chang Yu’s note makes the meaning clear: \"If the enemy shows an inclination to advance, lure him on to do so; if he is anxious to retreat, delay on purpose that he may carry out his intention.\" The object is to make him remiss and contemptuous before we deliver our attack.]\n\n61\\.

He who intends therefore, to occupy a position of importance to the enemy, must begin by making an artful appointment, so to speak, with his antagonist, and cajole him into going there as well.\" Mei Yao-ch’en explains that this \"artful appointment\" is to be made through the medium of the enemy’s own spies, who will carry back just the amount of information that we choose to give them. Then, having cunningly disclosed our intentions, \"we must manage, though starting after the enemy, to arrive before him (VII. § 4). We must start after him in order to ensure his marching thither; we must arrive before him in order to capture the place without trouble. Taken thus, the present passage lends some support to Mei Yao-ch’en’s interpretation of § 47.]",

Pan Ch’ao, sent on a diplomatic mission to the King of Shan-shan [see XI. § 51, note], found himself placed in extreme peril by the unexpected arrival of an envoy from the Hsiung-nu [the mortal enemies of the Chinese]. In consultation with his officers, he exclaimed: \"Never venture, never win! [1] The only course open to us now is to make an assault by fire on the barbarians under cover of night, when they will not be able to discern our numbers. Profiting by their panic, we shall exterminate them completely; this will cool the King’s courage and cover us with glory, besides ensuring the success of our mission.’ The officers all replied that it would be necessary to discuss the matter first with the Intendant. Pan Ch’ao then fell into a passion: ‘It is today,’ he cried, ‘that our fortunes must be decided! The Intendant is only a humdrum civilian, who on hearing of our project will certainly be afraid, and everything will be brought to light. An inglorious death is no worthy fate for valiant warriors.’ All then agreed to do as he wished. Accordingly, as soon as night came on, he and his little band quickly made their way to the barbarian camp. A strong gale was blowing at the time. Pan Ch’ao ordered ten of the party to take drums and hide behind the enemy’s barracks, it being arranged that when they saw flames shoot up, they should begin drumming and yelling with all their might. The rest of his men, armed with bows and crossbows, he posted in ambuscade at the gate of the camp. He then set fire to the place from the windward side, whereupon a deafening noise of drums and shouting arose on the front and rear of the Hsiung-nu, who rushed out pell-mell in frantic disorder. Pan Ch’ao slew three of them with his own hand, while his companions cut off the heads of the envoy and thirty of his suite. The remainder, more than a hundred in all, perished in the flames. On the following day, Pan Ch’ao, divining his thoughts, said with uplifted hand: ‘Although you did not go with us last night, I should not think, Sir, of taking sole credit for our exploit.’ This satisfied Kuo Hsun, and Pan Ch’ao, having sent for Kuang, King of Shan-shan, showed him the head of the barbarian envoy. The whole kingdom was seized with fear and trembling, which Pan Ch’ao took steps to allay by issuing a public proclamation. Then, taking the king’s sons as hostage, he returned to make his report to Tou Ku.\" _Hou Han Shu_, ch. 47, ff. 1, 2.] ]",
