    "## Rewriting Landing Pages with a Pro Copywriter\n\nHarry Dry teamed up with Annie Maguire, a professional copywriter, to rewrite real landing page titles submitted by startups. Each rewrite demonstrates a core copywriting principle: clarity over cleverness, selling outcomes not features, leading with your uniqueness, replacing vague language with specifics, and handling customer objections.",
    "## 1) Everydae — Lead with value, not jargon\n\n**Before → After rewrite (Everydae):**\n- Before: Title: \"Meet the next generation of SAT prep.\" / Subtitle: \"Ace the SAT in 10 Mins / Day\" / 5 stars / CTA: \"Watch the Video\"\n- After: Title: \"Ace the SAT with just 10-minutes of studying a day\" / CTA: \"Get started for just $1\" / Social proof: user photos + \"5/5 (from 700+ users)\"\n- Lesson: Put yourself in the customer's shoes. Kids don't care about \"the next generation of SAT prep\" — they care about acing the SAT. The real value was buried in the subtitle, so pull it up to the title. The $1 trial was hidden — make it the CTA. And make social proof feel REALER with user photos and a specific count instead of anonymous stars.",
    "## 2) Banquist — Let a unique product speak for itself\n\n**Before → After rewrite (Banquist):**\n- Before: Title: \"Become a Masterchef.\" / CTA: \"Book Now\"\n- After: Title: \"Virtual cooking classes. Taught by Michelin-star chefs.\" / CTA: \"Book Now\"\n- Lesson: \"Become a Masterchef\" is vague — it could mean fifty different things. Banquist is a unique product, so the golden rule is to let the product speak for itself. The rewrite explains exactly what it is (virtual cooking classes) and what makes it special (Michelin-star chefs). When your product is unique, clarity beats cleverness.",
    "## 3) Dormio — Sell the outcome, not the product\n\n**Before → After rewrite (Dormio):**\n- Before: Title: \"Peace of mind in a cup\" / Subtitle: \"calming and sleepy teas\" / CTA: \"SHOP NOW\"\n- After: Title: \"Your most restful sleep is just a sip away\" / Subtitle: \"Calming teas that help you relax, unwind, and drift into deep, restorative sleep.\" / CTA: \"SHOP NOW\"\n- Lesson: Customers buy outcomes, not products. \"Peace of mind in a cup\" is abstract. The rewrite sells the outcome the customer actually wants — deep, restorative sleep. The subtitle paints a vivid picture of the journey: relax, unwind, drift into sleep. Outcome-driven copy is always more compelling than product-description copy.",
    "## 4) JobBoardSheet — Handle objections with specifics\n\n**Before → After rewrite (JobBoardSheet):**\n- Before: Title: \"Create a job board from Google Sheets or Airtable\" / Subtitle: \"Run a successful job board business from a spreadsheet. No code, design skills required.\" / CTA: \"Start Free Trial\"\n- After: Title: \"Get a fully functional job board in 10 minutes, without writing code or paying $1000+\" / Subtitle: \"Run a successful job board business from a spreadsheet. No code, design skills required.\"\n- Lesson: The original copy is clear but forgettable. The rewrite handles the customer's four main objections in one sentence: QUALITY (\"fully functional\"), TIME (\"10 minutes\"), DIFFICULTY (\"without writing code\"), and COST (\"paying $1000+\"). Each objection is addressed with a specific, concrete detail. Specifics make copy memorable.",
    "## 5) Silva — Sell the adventure, not the specs\n\n**Before → After rewrite (Silva):**\n- Before: Title: \"TRAIL RUNNER FREE\" / Subtitle: \"The World's Most Comfortable Headlamp\" / CTA: \"DISCOVER TRAIL RUNNER FREE\"\n- After: Title: \"A SPOTLIGHT FOR ALL YOUR ADVENTURES\" / Subtitle: \"Meet the Award-winning Headlamp Athletes rely on to Light the Path Ahead\"\n- Lesson: \"Trail Runner Free\" is confusing — is that the product name? Is it free? And there's no emotional pull. People don't get excited by a new headlamp — they get excited by new adventures. Sell the emotion your product enables, not the product specs.",
    "## 6) Socios — Own the real problem, add social proof\n\n**Before → After rewrite (Socios):**\n- Before: Title: \"Get Fan Tokens, vote on exclusive team surveys & be rewarded\" / CTA: \"Get the app\"\n- After: Title: \"How fans get their voice heard\" / Subtitle: \"Join 100k football fans having their say about the club they love\" / CTA: \"Get the app\" / Social proof: club logos (Barcelona, etc.) + \"100+ clubs\"\n- Lesson: Football fans don't care about \"tokens\", \"surveys\", and \"rewards\" — that's product jargon. The real problem Socios solves is that fans want their voices heard. Take ownership of the real problem. Also, add social proof — you're literally working with Barcelona and 100+ clubs! Don't hide your best assets.",
    "## 7) Counterweight Creative — Replace vague words with specifics\n\n**Before → After rewrite (Counterweight Creative):**\n- Before: Title: \"Become the go-to authority in your space through podcasting\" / Subtitle: \"Connect with the right people and become the one and only in your health + wellness niche\" / CTA: \"Find out how\"\n- After: Title: \"A proven framework for launching your health & wellness podcast\" / Social proof: \"In 2020 we've helped 258 podcasts rack up 17,679,124 downloads\" + podcast cover art\n- Lesson: The original language is too vague — \"go-to authority\", \"right people\", \"one and only\" all feel like empty promises that don't feel REAL. The rewrite replaces every vague word with a specific one: \"proven framework\", \"health & wellness podcast\", \"258 podcasts\", \"17,679,124 downloads\". You can't bullshit specifics.",
    "## 8) Haako — Condense, don't overload\n\n**Before → After rewrite (Haako):**\n- Before: Title: \"Haako - Wheels at your door\" / Body: A huge text block: \"Haako is an ultimate solution for hotel guests in order to explore the nearby areas, go to work, or to meet the loved ones. We provide Bikes and Electric-scooters to get you where you want to go...\"\n- After: Title: \"The fun, fast & sustainable way to explore new cities\" / Visual: Photo of someone riding a bike on a sunny beachfront\n- Lesson: You can't expect people to read a huge text block to understand your product. Condense the entire value into one sentence. Add an image to bring the product to life — show someone actually using it. Repackaging matters as much as rewriting. Sometimes less copy is better copy.",
    "## 9) Ladybird — Lead with what makes you unique\n\n**Before → After rewrite (Ladybird):**\n- Before: Title: \"Pass First Time\" + \"Get Driving Lessons Dublin\" / CTAs: \"EDT\", \"Auto\", \"Pretest\", \"Car Hire\" (four separate buttons)\n- After: Title: \"Ireland's only all-female Instructor driving school\" / Subtitle: \"Get driving lessons in Dublin at your pace and within your budget.\"\n- Lesson: Ladybird's uniqueness is that all their instructors are female — but they buried it halfway down the page and led with a generic \"Get Driving Lessons Dublin\" instead. Don't bury your differentiator. Lead with it. Write the title only you can write."
