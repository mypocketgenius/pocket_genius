    "## Chapter XII. THE ATTACK BY FIRE\n\n2\\. In order to carry out an attack, we must have means available.\n\n[T’sao Kung thinks that \"traitors in the enemy’s camp\" are referred to. But Ch’en Hao is more likely to be right in saying: \"We must have favourable circumstances in general, not merely traitors to help us.\" Chia Lin says: \"We must avail ourselves of wind and dry weather.\"]\n\nthe material for raising fire should always be kept in readiness.\n\n[Tu Mu suggests as material for making fire: \"dry vegetable matter, reeds, brushwood, straw, grease, oil, etc.\" Here we have the material cause. Chang Yu says: \"vessels for hoarding fire, stuff for lighting fires.\"]\n\n3\\. There is a proper season for making attacks with fire, and special days for starting a conflagration.\n\n4\\. The proper season is when the weather is very dry; the special days are those when the moon is in the constellations of the Sieve, the Wall, the Wing or the Cross-bar;\n\n[These are, respectively, the 7th, 14th, 27th, and 28th of the Twenty-eight Stellar Mansions, corresponding roughly to Sagittarius, Pegasus, Crater and Corvus.]\n\nfor these four are all days of rising wind.\n\n5\\. In attacking with fire, one should be prepared to meet five possible developments:\n\n6\\. (1) When fire breaks out inside the enemy’s camp, respond at once with an attack from without.",
    "## Chapter XII. THE ATTACK BY FIRE\n\n7\\. (2) If there is an outbreak of fire, but the enemy’s soldiers remain quiet, bide your time and do not attack.\n\n[The prime object of attacking with fire is to throw the enemy into confusion. If this effect is not produced, it means that the enemy is ready to receive us. Hence the necessity for caution.]\n\n8\\. (3) When the force of the flames has reached its height, follow it up with an attack, if that is practicable; if not, stay where you are.\n\n[Ts’ao Kung says: \"If you see a possible way, advance; but if you find the difficulties too great, retire.\"]",
    "## Chapter XII. THE ATTACK BY FIRE\n\n9\\. (4) If it is possible to make an assault with fire from without, do not wait for it to break out within, but deliver your attack at a favourable moment.",
    "## Chapter XII. THE ATTACK BY FIRE\n\n[Tu Mu says that the previous paragraphs had reference to the fire breaking out (either accidentally, we may suppose, or by the agency of incendiaries) inside the enemy’s camp. \"But,\" he continues, \"if the enemy is settled in a waste place littered with quantities of grass, or if he has pitched his camp in a position which can be burnt out, we must carry our fire against him at any seasonable opportunity, and not await on in hopes of an outbreak occurring within, for fear our opponents should themselves burn up the surrounding vegetation, and thus render our own attempts fruitless.\" The famous Li Ling once baffled the leader of the Hsiung-nu in this way. The latter, taking advantage of a favourable wind, tried to set fire to the Chinese general’s camp, but found that every scrap of combustible vegetation in the neighbourhood had already been burnt down. On the other hand, Po-ts’ai, a general of the Yellow Turban rebels, was badly defeated in 184 A.D. through his neglect of this simple precaution. \"At the head of a large army he was besieging Ch’ang-she, which was held by Huang-fu Sung. The garrison was very small, and a general feeling of nervousness pervaded the ranks; so Huang-fu Sung called his officers together and said: \"In war, there are various indirect methods of attack, and numbers do not count for everything. [The commentator here quotes Sun Tzŭ, V. §§ 5, 6 and 10.] Now the rebels have pitched their camp in the midst of thick grass which will easily burn when the wind blows. If we set fire to it at night, they will be thrown into a panic, and we can make a sortie and attack them on all sides at once, thus emulating the achievement of T’ien Tan.’ [See p. 90.] That same evening, a strong breeze sprang up; so Huang-fu Sung instructed his soldiers to bind reeds together into torches and mount guard on the city walls, after which he sent out a band of daring men, who stealthily made their way through the lines and started the fire with loud shouts and yells. Simultaneously, a glare of light shot up from the city walls, and Huang-fu Sung, sounding his drums, led a rapid charge, which threw the rebels into confusion and put them to headlong flight.\" [_Hou Han Shu_, ch. 71.] ]",
    "## Chapter XII. THE ATTACK BY FIRE\n\n10\\. (5) When you start a fire, be to windward of it. Do not attack from the leeward.\n\n[Chang Yu, following Tu Yu, says: \"When you make a fire, the enemy will retreat away from it; if you oppose his retreat and attack him then, he will fight desperately, which will not conduce to your success.\" A rather more obvious explanation is given by Tu Mu: \"If the wind is in the east, begin burning to the east of the enemy, and follow up the attack yourself from that side. If you start the fire on the east side, and then attack from the west, you will suffer in the same way as your enemy.\"]\n\n11\\. A wind that rises in the daytime lasts long, but a night breeze soon falls.\n\n[Cf. Lao Tzŭ’s saying: \"A violent wind does not last the space of a morning.\" (_Tao Te Ching_, chap. 23.) Mei Yao-ch’en and Wang Hsi say: \"A day breeze dies down at nightfall, and a night breeze at daybreak. This is what happens as a general rule.\" The phenomenon observed may be correct enough, but how this sense is to be obtained is not apparent.]",
    "## Chapter XII. THE ATTACK BY FIRE\n\n12\\. In every army, the five developments connected with fire must be known, the movements of the stars calculated, and a watch kept for the proper days.\n\n[Tu Mu says: \"We must make calculations as to the paths of the stars, and watch for the days on which wind will rise, before making our attack with fire.\" Chang Yu seems to interpret the text differently: \"We must not only know how to assail our opponents with fire, but also be on our guard against similar attacks from them.\"]\n\n13\\. Hence those who use fire as an aid to the attack show intelligence; those who use water as an aid to the attack gain an accession of strength.\n\n14\\. By means of water, an enemy may be intercepted, but not robbed of all his belongings.\n\n[Ts’ao Kung’s note is: \"We can merely obstruct the enemy’s road or divide his army, but not sweep away all his accumulated stores.\" Water can do useful service, but it lacks the terrible destructive power of fire. This is the reason, Chang Yu concludes, why the former is dismissed in a couple of sentences, whereas the attack by fire is discussed in detail. Wu Tzŭ (ch. 4) speaks thus of the two elements: \"If an army is encamped on low-lying marshy ground, from which the water cannot run off, and where the rainfall is heavy, it may be submerged by a flood. If an army is encamped in wild marsh lands thickly overgrown with weeds and brambles, and visited by frequent gales, it may be exterminated by fire.\"]",
    "## Chapter XII. THE ATTACK BY FIRE\n\n15\\. Unhappy is the fate of one who tries to win his battles and succeed in his attacks without cultivating the spirit of enterprise; for the result is waste of time and general stagnation.\n\n[This is one of the most perplexing passages in Sun Tzŭ. Ts’ao Kung says: \"Rewards for good service should not be deferred a single day.\" And Tu Mu: \"If you do not take opportunity to advance and reward the deserving, your subordinates will not carry out your commands, and disaster will ensue.\" For several reasons, however, and in spite of the formidable array of scholars on the other side, I prefer the interpretation suggested by Mei Yao-ch’en alone, whose words I will quote: \"Those who want to make sure of succeeding in their battles and assaults must seize the favourable moments when they come and not shrink on occasion from heroic measures: that is to say, they must resort to such means of attack of fire, water and the like. What they must not do, and what will prove fatal, is to sit still and simply hold to the advantages they have got.\"]\n\n16\\. Hence the saying: The enlightened ruler lays his plans well ahead; the good general cultivates his resources.\n\n[Tu Mu quotes the following from the _San Lueh_, ch. 2: \"The warlike prince controls his soldiers by his authority, kits them together by good faith, and by rewards makes them serviceable. If faith decays, there will be disruption; if rewards are deficient, commands will not be respected.\"]",
    "## Chapter XII. THE ATTACK BY FIRE\n\n17\\. Move not unless you see an advantage; use not your troops unless there is something to be gained; fight not unless the position is critical.\n\n[Sun Tzŭ may at times appear to be over-cautious, but he never goes so far in that direction as the remarkable passage in the _Tao Te Ching_, ch. 69. \"I dare not take the initiative, but prefer to act on the defensive; I dare not advance an inch, but prefer to retreat a foot.\"]\n\n18\\. No ruler should put troops into the field merely to gratify his own spleen; no general should fight a battle simply out of pique.\n\n19\\. If it is to your advantage, make a forward move; if not, stay where you are.\n\n[This is repeated from XI. § 17. Here I feel convinced that it is an interpolation, for it is evident that § 20 ought to follow immediately on § 18.]\n\n20\\. Anger may in time change to gladness; vexation may be succeeded by content.\n\n21\\. But a kingdom that has once been destroyed can never come again into being;\n\n[The Wu State was destined to be a melancholy example of this saying.]\n\nnor can the dead ever be brought back to life.\n\n22\\. Hence the enlightened ruler is heedful, and the good general full of caution. This is the way to keep a country at peace and an army intact.\n\n[1] \"Unless you enter the tiger’s lair, you cannot get hold of the tiger’s cubs.\"",
    "## Chapter XIII. THE USE OF SPIES",
    "1\\. Sun Tzŭ said: Raising a host of a hundred thousand men and marching them great distances entails heavy loss on the people and a drain on the resources of the State. The daily expenditure will amount to a thousand ounces of silver.\n\n[Cf. II. §§ 1, 13, 14.]\n\nThere will be commotion at home and abroad, and men will drop down exhausted on the highways.\n\n[Cf. _Tao Te Ching_, ch. 30: \"Where troops have been quartered, brambles and thorns spring up. Chang Yu has the note: \"We may be reminded of the saying: ‘On serious ground, gather in plunder.’ Why then should carriage and transportation cause exhaustion on the highways?—The answer is, that not victuals alone, but all sorts of munitions of war have to be conveyed to the army. Besides, the injunction to ‘forage on the enemy’ only means that when an army is deeply engaged in hostile territory, scarcity of food must be provided against. Hence, without being solely dependent on the enemy for corn, we must forage in order that there may be an uninterrupted flow of supplies. Then, again, there are places like salt deserts where provisions being unobtainable, supplies from home cannot be dispensed with.\"]\n\nAs many as seven hundred thousand families will be impeded in their labor.",
    "## Chapter XIII. THE USE OF SPIES\n\n[Mei Yao-ch’en says: \"Men will be lacking at the plough-tail.\" The allusion is to the system of dividing land into nine parts, each consisting of about 15 acres, the plot in the center being cultivated on behalf of the State by the tenants of the other eight. It was here also, so Tu Mu tells us, that their cottages were built and a well sunk, to be used by all in common. [See II. § 12, note.] In time of war, one of the families had to serve in the army, while the other seven contributed to its support. Thus, by a levy of 100,000 men (reckoning one able-bodied soldier to each family) the husbandry of 700,000 families would be affected.]",
    "## Chapter XIII. THE USE OF SPIES\n\n2\\. Hostile armies may face each other for years, striving for the victory which is decided in a single day. This being so, to remain in ignorance of the enemy’s condition simply because one grudges the outlay of a hundred ounces of silver in honours and emoluments,\n\n[\"For spies\" is of course the meaning, though it would spoil the effect of this curiously elaborate exordium if spies were actually mentioned at this point.]\n\nis the height of inhumanity.\n\n[Sun Tzŭ’s agreement is certainly ingenious. He begins by adverting to the frightful misery and vast expenditure of blood and treasure which war always brings in its train. Now, unless you are kept informed of the enemy’s condition, and are ready to strike at the right moment, a war may drag on for years. The only way to get this information is to employ spies, and it is impossible to obtain trustworthy spies unless they are properly paid for their services. But it is surely false economy to grudge a comparatively trifling amount for this purpose, when every day that the war lasts eats up an incalculably greater sum. This grievous burden falls on the shoulders of the poor, and hence Sun Tzŭ concludes that to neglect the use of spies is nothing less than a crime against humanity.]",
    "## Chapter XIII. THE USE OF SPIES\n\n3\\. One who acts thus is no leader of men, no present help to his sovereign, no master of victory.\n\n[This idea, that the true object of war is peace, has its root in the national temperament of the Chinese. Even so far back as 597 B.C., these memorable words were uttered by Prince Chuang of the Ch’u State: \"The [Chinese] character for ‘prowess’ is made up of [the characters for] ‘to stay’ and ‘a spear’ (cessation of hostilities). Military prowess is seen in the repression of cruelty, the calling in of weapons, the preservation of the appointment of Heaven, the firm establishment of merit, the bestowal of happiness on the people, putting harmony between the princes, the diffusion of wealth.\"]\n\n4\\. Thus, what enables the wise sovereign and the good general to strike and conquer, and achieve things beyond the reach of ordinary men, is _foreknowledge_.\n\n[That is, knowledge of the enemy’s dispositions, and what he means to do.]\n\n5\\. Now this foreknowledge cannot be elicited from spirits; it cannot be obtained inductively from experience,\n\n[Tu Mu’s note is: \"[knowledge of the enemy] cannot be gained by reasoning from other analogous cases.\"]\n\nnor by any deductive calculation.\n\n[Li Ch’uan says: \"Quantities like length, breadth, distance and magnitude, are susceptible of exact mathematical determination; human actions cannot be so calculated.\"]",
    "## Chapter XIII. THE USE OF SPIES\n\n6\\. Knowledge of the enemy’s dispositions can only be obtained from other men.\n\n[Mei Yao-ch’en has rather an interesting note: \"Knowledge of the spirit-world is to be obtained by divination; information in natural science may be sought by inductive reasoning; the laws of the universe can be verified by mathematical calculation: but the dispositions of an enemy are ascertainable through spies and spies alone.\"]\n\n7\\. Hence the use of spies, of whom there are five classes: (1) Local spies; (2) inward spies; (3) converted spies; (4) doomed spies; (5) surviving spies.\n\n8\\. When these five kinds of spy are all at work, none can discover the secret system. This is called \"divine manipulation of the threads.\" It is the sovereign’s most precious faculty.\n\n[Cromwell, one of the greatest and most practical of all cavalry leaders, had officers styled ‘scout masters,’ whose business it was to collect all possible information regarding the enemy, through scouts and spies, etc., and much of his success in war was traceable to the previous knowledge of the enemy’s moves thus gained.\" [1] ]\n\n9\\. Having _local spies_ means employing the services of the inhabitants of a district.\n\n[Tu Mu says: \"In the enemy’s country, win people over by kind treatment, and use them as spies.\"]",
    "## Chapter XIII. THE USE OF SPIES\n\n10\\. Having _inward spies_, making use of officials of the enemy.",
    "## Chapter XIII. THE USE OF SPIES\n\n[Tu Mu enumerates the following classes as likely to do good service in this respect: \"Worthy men who have been degraded from office, criminals who have undergone punishment; also, favourite concubines who are greedy for gold, men who are aggrieved at being in subordinate positions, or who have been passed over in the distribution of posts, others who are anxious that their side should be defeated in order that they may have a chance of displaying their ability and talents, fickle turncoats who always want to have a foot in each boat. Officials of these several kinds,\" he continues, \"should be secretly approached and bound to one’s interests by means of rich presents. In this way you will be able to find out the state of affairs in the enemy’s country, ascertain the plans that are being formed against you, and moreover disturb the harmony and create a breach between the sovereign and his ministers.\" The necessity for extreme caution, however, in dealing with \"inward spies,\" appears from an historical incident related by Ho Shih: \"Lo Shang, Governor of I-Chou, sent his general Wei Po to attack the rebel Li Hsiung of Shu in his stronghold at P’i. After each side had experienced a number of victories and defeats, Li Hsiung had recourse to the services of a certain P’o-t’ai, a native of Wu-tu. He began to have him whipped until the blood came, and then sent him off to Lo Shang, whom he was to delude by offering to cooperate with him from inside the city, and to give a fire signal at the right moment for making a general assault. Lo Shang, confiding in these promises, march out all his best troops, and placed Wei Po and others at their head with orders to attack at P’o-t’ai’s bidding. Meanwhile, Li Hsiung’s general, Li Hsiang, had prepared an ambuscade on their line of march; and P’o-t’ai, having reared long scaling-ladders against the city walls, now lighted the beacon-fire. Wei Po’s men raced up on seeing the signal and began climbing the ladders as fast as they could, while others were drawn up by ropes lowered from above. More than a hundred of Lo Shang’s soldiers entered the city in this way, every one of whom was forthwith beheaded. Li Hsiung then charged with all his forces, both inside and outside the city, and routed the enemy completely.\" [This happened in 303 A.D. I do not know where Ho Shih got the story from. It is not given in the biography of Li Hsiung or that of his father Li T’e, _Chin Shu_, ch. 120, 121.]",
    "## Chapter XIII. THE USE OF SPIES\n\n11\\. Having _converted spies_, getting hold of the enemy’s spies and using them for our own purposes.",
    "## Chapter XIII. THE USE OF SPIES\n\n[By means of heavy bribes and liberal promises detaching them from the enemy’s service, and inducing them to carry back false information as well as to spy in turn on their own countrymen. On the other hand, Hsiao Shih-hsien says that we pretend not to have detected him, but contrive to let him carry away a false impression of what is going on. Several of the commentators accept this as an alternative definition; but that it is not what Sun Tzŭ meant is conclusively proved by his subsequent remarks about treating the converted spy generously (§ 21 sqq.). Ho Shih notes three occasions on which converted spies were used with conspicuous success: (1) by T’ien Tan in his defence of Chi-mo (see _supra_, p. 90); (2) by Chao She on his march to O-yu (see p. 57); and by the wily Fan Chu in 260 B.C., when Lien P’o was conducting a defensive campaign against Ch’in. The King of Chao strongly disapproved of Lien P’o’s cautious and dilatory methods, which had been unable to avert a series of minor disasters, and therefore lent a ready ear to the reports of his spies, who had secretly gone over to the enemy and were already in Fan Chu’s pay. They said: \"The only thing which causes Ch’in anxiety is lest Chao Kua should be made general. Lien P’o they consider an easy opponent, who is sure to be vanquished in the long run.\" Now this Chao Kua was a son of the famous Chao She. From his boyhood, he had been wholly engrossed in the study of war and military matters, until at last he came to believe that there was no commander in the whole Empire who could stand against him. His father was much disquieted by this overweening conceit, and the flippancy with which he spoke of such a serious thing as war, and solemnly declared that if ever Kua was appointed general, he would bring ruin on the armies of Chao. This was the man who, in spite of earnest protests from his own mother and the veteran statesman Lin Hsiang-ju, was now sent to succeed Lien P’o. Needless to say, he proved no match for the redoubtable Po Ch’i and the great military power of Ch’in. He fell into a trap by which his army was divided into two and his communications cut; and after a desperate resistance lasting 46 days, during which the famished soldiers devoured one another, he was himself killed by an arrow, and his whole force, amounting, it is said, to 400,000 men, ruthlessly put to the sword.]",
    "## Chapter XIII. THE USE OF SPIES\n\n12\\. Having _doomed spies_, doing certain things openly for purposes of deception, and allowing our own spies to know of them and report them to the enemy.",
    "## Chapter XIII. THE USE OF SPIES\n\n[Tu Yu gives the best exposition of the meaning: \"We ostentatiously do things calculated to deceive our own spies, who must be led to believe that they have been unwittingly disclosed. Then, when these spies are captured in the enemy’s lines, they will make an entirely false report, and the enemy will take measures accordingly, only to find that we do something quite different. The spies will thereupon be put to death.\" As an example of doomed spies, Ho Shih mentions the prisoners released by Pan Ch’ao in his campaign against Yarkand. (See p. 132.) He also refers to T’ang Chien, who in 630 A.D. was sent by T’ai Tsung to lull the Turkish Kahn Chieh-li into fancied security, until Li Ching was able to deliver a crushing blow against him. Chang Yu says that the Turks revenged themselves by killing T’ang Chien, but this is a mistake, for we read in both the old and the New T’ang History (ch. 58, fol. 2 and ch. 89, fol. 8 respectively) that he escaped and lived on until 656. Li I-chi played a somewhat similar part in 203 B.C., when sent by the King of Han to open peaceful negotiations with Ch’i. He has certainly more claim to be described a \"doomed spy\", for the king of Ch’i, being subsequently attacked without warning by Han Hsin, and infuriated by what he considered the treachery of Li I-chi, ordered the unfortunate envoy to be boiled alive.]",
    "## Chapter XIII. THE USE OF SPIES\n\n13\\. _Surviving spies_, finally, are those who bring back news from the enemy’s camp.",
    "## Chapter XIII. THE USE OF SPIES\n\n[This is the ordinary class of spies, properly so called, forming a regular part of the army. Tu Mu says: \"Your surviving spy must be a man of keen intellect, though in outward appearance a fool; of shabby exterior, but with a will of iron. He must be active, robust, endowed with physical strength and courage; thoroughly accustomed to all sorts of dirty work, able to endure hunger and cold, and to put up with shame and ignominy.\" Ho Shih tells the following story of Ta’hsi Wu of the Sui dynasty: \"When he was governor of Eastern Ch’in, Shen-wu of Ch’i made a hostile movement upon Sha-yuan. The Emperor T’ai Tsu [? Kao Tsu] sent Ta-hsi Wu to spy upon the enemy. He was accompanied by two other men. All three were on horseback and wore the enemy’s uniform. When it was dark, they dismounted a few hundred feet away from the enemy’s camp and stealthily crept up to listen, until they succeeded in catching the passwords used in the army. Then they got on their horses again and boldly passed through the camp under the guise of night-watchmen; and more than once, happening to come across a soldier who was committing some breach of discipline, they actually stopped to give the culprit a sound cudgeling! Thus they managed to return with the fullest possible information about the enemy’s dispositions, and received warm commendation from the Emperor, who in consequence of their report was able to inflict a severe defeat on his adversary.\"]",
    "## Chapter XIII. THE USE OF SPIES\n\n14\\. Hence it is that with none in the whole army are more intimate relations to be maintained than with spies.\n\n[Tu Mu and Mei Yao-ch’en point out that the spy is privileged to enter even the general’s private sleeping-tent.]\n\nNone should be more liberally rewarded. In no other business should greater secrecy be preserved.\n\n[Tu Mu gives a graphic touch: all communication with spies should be carried \"mouth-to-ear.\" The following remarks on spies may be quoted from Turenne, who made perhaps larger use of them than any previous commander: \"Spies are attached to those who give them most, he who pays them ill is never served. They should never be known to anybody; nor should they know one another. When they propose anything very material, secure their persons, or have in your possession their wives and children as hostages for their fidelity. Never communicate anything to them but what is absolutely necessary that they should know. [2] ]",
    "## Chapter XIII. THE USE OF SPIES\n\n15\\. Spies cannot be usefully employed without a certain intuitive sagacity.\n\n[Mei Yao-ch’en says: \"In order to use them, one must know fact from falsehood, and be able to discriminate between honesty and double-dealing.\" Wang Hsi in a different interpretation thinks more along the lines of \"intuitive perception\" and \"practical intelligence.\" Tu Mu strangely refers these attributes to the spies themselves: \"Before using spies we must assure ourselves as to their integrity of character and the extent of their experience and skill.\" But he continues: \"A brazen face and a crafty disposition are more dangerous than mountains or rivers; it takes a man of genius to penetrate such.\" So that we are left in some doubt as to his real opinion on the passage.\"]\n\n16\\. They cannot be properly managed without benevolence and straightforwardness.\n\n[Chang Yu says: \"When you have attracted them by substantial offers, you must treat them with absolute sincerity; then they will work for you with all their might.\"]\n\n17\\. Without subtle ingenuity of mind, one cannot make certain of the truth of their reports.\n\n[Mei Yao-ch’en says: \"Be on your guard against the possibility of spies going over to the service of the enemy.\"]\n\n18\\. Be subtle! be subtle! and use your spies for every kind of business.\n\n[Cf. VI. § 9.]",
    "## Chapter XIII. THE USE OF SPIES\n\n19\\. If a secret piece of news is divulged by a spy before the time is ripe, he must be put to death together with the man to whom the secret was told.\n\n[Word for word, the translation here is: \"If spy matters are heard before [our plans] are carried out,\" etc. Sun Tzŭ’s main point in this passage is: Whereas you kill the spy himself \"as a punishment for letting out the secret,\" the object of killing the other man is only, as Ch’en Hao puts it, \"to stop his mouth\" and prevent news leaking any further. If it had already been repeated to others, this object would not be gained. Either way, Sun Tzŭ lays himself open to the charge of inhumanity, though Tu Mu tries to defend him by saying that the man deserves to be put to death, for the spy would certainly not have told the secret unless the other had been at pains to worm it out of him.\"]\n\n20\\. Whether the object be to crush an army, to storm a city, or to assassinate an individual, it is always necessary to begin by finding out the names of the attendants, the aides-de- camp,\n\n[Literally \"visitors\", is equivalent, as Tu Yu says, to \"those whose duty it is to keep the general supplied with information,\" which naturally necessitates frequent interviews with him.]\n\nthe door-keepers and sentries of the general in command. Our spies must be commissioned to ascertain these.\n\n[As the first step, no doubt towards finding out if any of these important functionaries can be won over by bribery.]",
    "## Chapter XIII. THE USE OF SPIES\n\n21\\. The enemy’s spies who have come to spy on us must be sought out, tempted with bribes, led away and comfortably housed. Thus they will become converted spies and available for our service.\n\n22\\. It is through the information brought by the converted spy that we are able to acquire and employ local and inward spies.\n\n[Tu Yu says: \"through conversion of the enemy’s spies we learn the enemy’s condition.\" And Chang Yu says: \"We must tempt the converted spy into our service, because it is he that knows which of the local inhabitants are greedy of gain, and which of the officials are open to corruption.\"]\n\n23\\. It is owing to his information, again, that we can cause the doomed spy to carry false tidings to the enemy.\n\n[Chang Yu says, \"because the converted spy knows how the enemy can best be deceived.\"]\n\n24\\. Lastly, it is by his information that the surviving spy can be used on appointed occasions.\n\n25\\. The end and aim of spying in all its five varieties is knowledge of the enemy; and this knowledge can only be derived, in the first instance, from the converted spy.\n\n[As explained in §§ 22-24. He not only brings information himself, but makes it possible to use the other kinds of spy to advantage.]\n\nHence it is essential that the converted spy be treated with the utmost liberality.",
    "## Chapter XIII. THE USE OF SPIES\n\n26\\. Of old, the rise of the Yin dynasty\n\n[Sun Tzŭ means the Shang dynasty, founded in 1766 B.C. Its name was changed to Yin by P’an Keng in 1401.\n\nwas due to I Chih\n\n[Better known as I Yin, the famous general and statesman who took part in Ch’eng T’ang’s campaign against Chieh Kuei.]\n\nwho had served under the Hsia. Likewise, the rise of the Chou dynasty was due to Lü Ya\n\n[Lu Shang rose to high office under the tyrant Chou Hsin, whom he afterwards helped to overthrow. Popularly known as T’ai Kung, a title bestowed on him by Wen Wang, he is said to have composed a treatise on war, erroneously identified with the _Liu T’ao_.]\n\nwho had served under the Yin.",
    "## Chapter XIII. THE USE OF SPIES\n\n[There is less precision in the Chinese than I have thought it well to introduce into my translation, and the commentaries on the passage are by no means explicit. But, having regard to the context, we can hardly doubt that Sun Tzŭ is holding up I Chih and Lu Ya as illustrious examples of the converted spy, or something closely analogous. His suggestion is, that the Hsia and Yin dynasties were upset owing to the intimate knowledge of their weaknesses and shortcoming which these former ministers were able to impart to the other side. Mei Yao-ch’en appears to resent any such aspersion on these historic names: \"I Yin and Lu Ya,\" he says, \"were not rebels against the Government. Hsia could not employ the former, hence Yin employed him. Yin could not employ the latter, hence Hou employed him. Their great achievements were all for the good of the people.\" Ho Shih is also indignant: \"How should two divinely inspired men such as I and Lu have acted as common spies? Sun Tzŭ’s mention of them simply means that the proper use of the five classes of spies is a matter which requires men of the highest mental caliber like I and Lu, whose wisdom and capacity qualified them for the task.
