    "## Chapter I. LAYING PLANS\n\n[Ts’ao Kung, in defining the meaning of the Chinese for the title of this chapter, says it refers to the deliberations in the temple selected by the general for his temporary use, or as we should say, in his tent. See. § 26.]",
    "1\\. Sun Tzŭ said: The art of war is of vital importance to the State.\n\n2\\. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected.\n\n3\\. The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be taken into account in one’s deliberations, when seeking to determine the conditions obtaining in the field.\n\n4\\. These are: (1) The Moral Law; (2) Heaven; (3) Earth; (4) The Commander; (5) Method and discipline.\n\n[It appears from what follows that Sun Tzŭ means by \"Moral Law\" a principle of harmony, not unlike the Tao of Lao Tzŭ in its moral aspect. One might be tempted to render it by \"morale,\" were it not considered as an attribute of the _ruler_ in § 13.]\n\n5, 6. _The Moral Law_ causes the people to be in complete accord with their ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of their lives, undismayed by any danger.\n\n[Tu Yu quotes Wang Tzŭ as saying: \"Without constant practice, the officers will be nervous and undecided when mustering for battle; without constant practice, the general will be wavering and irresolute when the crisis is at hand.\"]",
    "## Chapter I. LAYING PLANS\n\n7\\. _Heaven_ signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons.\n\n[The commentators, I think, make an unnecessary mystery of two words here. Meng Shih refers to \"the hard and the soft, waxing and waning\" of Heaven. Wang Hsi, however, may be right in saying that what is meant is \"the general economy of Heaven,\" including the five elements, the four seasons, wind and clouds, and other phenomena.]\n\n8\\. _Earth_ comprises distances, great and small; danger and security; open ground and narrow passes; the chances of life and death.\n\n9\\. _The Commander_ stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerity, benevolence, courage and strictness.\n\n[The five cardinal virtues of the Chinese are (1) humanity or benevolence; (2) uprightness of mind; (3) self-respect, self-control, or \"proper feeling;\" (4) wisdom; (5) sincerity or good faith. Here \"wisdom\" and \"sincerity\" are put before \"humanity or benevolence,\" and the two military virtues of \"courage\" and \"strictness\" substituted for \"uprightness of mind\" and \"self-respect, self-control, or ‘proper feeling.’\"]\n\n10\\. By _Method and discipline_ are to be understood the marshalling of the army in its proper subdivisions, the gradations of rank among the officers, the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army, and the control of military expenditure.\n\n11\\. These five heads should be familiar to every general: he who knows them will be victorious; he who knows them not will fail.",
    "## Chapter I. LAYING PLANS\n\n12\\. Therefore, in your deliberations, when seeking to determine the military conditions, let them be made the basis of a comparison, in this wise:—",
    "## Chapter I. LAYING PLANS\n\n13\\. (1) Which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the Moral law?\n\n[I.e., \"is in harmony with his subjects.\" Cf. § 5.]\n\n(2) Which of the two generals has most ability?  \n    (3) With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven and Earth?\n\n[See §§ 7, 8]\n\n(4) On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced?\n\n[Tu Mu alludes to the remarkable story of Ts’ao Ts’ao (A.D. 155-220), who was such a strict disciplinarian that once, in accordance with his own severe regulations against injury to standing crops, he condemned himself to death for having allowed his horse to shy into a field of corn! However, in lieu of losing his head, he was persuaded to satisfy his sense of justice by cutting off his hair. Ts’ao Ts’ao’s own comment on the present passage is characteristically curt: \"when you lay down a law, see that it is not disobeyed; if it is disobeyed the offender must be put to death.\"]\n\n(5) Which army is the stronger?\n\n[Morally as well as physically. As Mei Yao-ch’en puts it, freely rendered, \"_esprit de corps_ and ‘big battalions.’\"]\n\n(6) On which side are officers and men more highly trained?\n\n[Tu Yu quotes Wang Tzŭ as saying: \"Without constant practice, the officers will be nervous and undecided when mustering for battle; without constant practice, the general will be wavering and irresolute when the crisis is at hand.\"]\n\n(7) In which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and punishment?",
    "## Chapter I. LAYING PLANS\n\n[On which side is there the most absolute certainty that merit will be properly rewarded and misdeeds summarily punished?]",
    "## Chapter I. LAYING PLANS\n\n14\\. By means of these seven considerations I can forecast victory or defeat.\n\n15\\. The general that hearkens to my counsel and acts upon it, will conquer:—let such a one be retained in command! The general that hearkens not to my counsel nor acts upon it, will suffer defeat:—let such a one be dismissed!\n\n[The form of this paragraph reminds us that Sun Tzŭ’s treatise was composed expressly for the benefit of his patron Ho Lu, king of the Wu State.]\n\n16\\. While heeding the profit of my counsel, avail yourself also of any helpful circumstances over and beyond the ordinary rules.",
    "## Chapter I. LAYING PLANS\n\n17\\. According as circumstances are favourable, one should modify one’s plans.\n\n[Sun Tzŭ, as a practical soldier, will have none of the \"bookish theoric.\" He cautions us here not to pin our faith to abstract principles; \"for,\" as Chang Yu puts it, \"while the main laws of strategy can be stated clearly enough for the benefit of all and sundry, you must be guided by the actions of the enemy in attempting to secure a favourable position in actual warfare.\" On the eve of the battle of Waterloo, Lord Uxbridge, commanding the cavalry, went to the Duke of Wellington in order to learn what his plans and calculations were for the morrow, because, as he explained, he might suddenly find himself Commander-in-chief and would be unable to frame new plans in a critical moment. The Duke listened quietly and then said: \"Who will attack the first tomorrow—I or Bonaparte?\" \"Bonaparte,\" replied Lord Uxbridge. \"Well,\" continued the Duke, \"Bonaparte has not given me any idea of his projects; and as my plans will depend upon his, how can you expect me to tell you what mine are?\" [1] ]\n\n18\\. All warfare is based on deception.\n\n[The truth of this pithy and profound saying will be admitted by every soldier. Col. Henderson tells us that Wellington, great in so many military qualities, was especially distinguished by \"the extraordinary skill with which he concealed his movements and deceived both friend and foe.\"]",
    "## Chapter I. LAYING PLANS\n\n19\\. Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near.\n\n20\\. Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him.\n\n[All commentators, except Chang Yu, say, \"When he is in disorder, crush him.\" It is more natural to suppose that Sun Tzŭ is still illustrating the uses of deception in war.]\n\n21\\. If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him.\n\n22\\. If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant.\n\n[Wang Tzŭ, quoted by Tu Yu, says that the good tactician plays with his adversary as a cat plays with a mouse, first feigning weakness and immobility, and then suddenly pouncing upon him.]\n\n23\\. If he is taking his ease, give him no rest.\n\n[This is probably the meaning though Mei Yao-ch’en has the note: \"while we are taking our ease, wait for the enemy to tire himself out.\" The _Yu Lan_ has \"Lure him on and tire him out.\"]\n\nIf his forces are united, separate them.\n\n[Less plausible is the interpretation favoured by most of the commentators: \"If sovereign and subject are in accord, put division between them.\"]\n\n24\\. Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.\n\n25\\. These military devices, leading to victory, must not be divulged beforehand.",
    "## Chapter I. LAYING PLANS\n\n26\\. Now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple ere the battle is fought.\n\n[Chang Yu tells us that in ancient times it was customary for a temple to be set apart for the use of a general who was about to take the field, in order that he might there elaborate his plan of campaign.]\n\nThe general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand. Thus do many calculations lead to victory, and few calculations to defeat: how much more no calculation at all! It is by attention to this point that I can foresee who is likely to win or lose.\n\n[1] \"Words on Wellington,\" by Sir. W. Fraser.",
    "## Chapter II. WAGING WAR\n\n[Ts’ao Kung has the note: \"He who wishes to fight must first count the cost,\" which prepares us for the discovery that the subject of the chapter is not what we might expect from the title, but is primarily a consideration of ways and means.]",
    "1\\. Sun Tzŭ said: In the operations of war, where there are in the field a thousand swift chariots, as many heavy chariots, and a hundred thousand mail-clad soldiers,\n\n[The \"swift chariots\" were lightly built and, according to Chang Yu, used for the attack; the \"heavy chariots\" were heavier, and designed for purposes of defence. Li Ch’uan, it is true, says that the latter were light, but this seems hardly probable. It is interesting to note the analogies between early Chinese warfare and that of the Homeric Greeks. In each case, the war-chariot was the important factor, forming as it did the nucleus round which was grouped a certain number of foot-soldiers. With regard to the numbers given here, we are informed that each swift chariot was accompanied by 75 footmen, and each heavy chariot by 25 footmen, so that the whole army would be divided up into a thousand battalions, each consisting of two chariots and a hundred men.]\n\nwith provisions enough to carry them a thousand _li_,\n\n[2.78 modern _li_ go to a mile. The length may have varied slightly since Sun Tzŭ’s time.]\n\nthe expenditure at home and at the front, including entertainment of guests, small items such as glue and paint, and sums spent on chariots and armour, will reach the total of a thousand ounces of silver per day. Such is the cost of raising an army of 100,000 men.",
    "## Chapter II. WAGING WAR\n\n2\\. When you engage in actual fighting, if victory is long in coming, the men’s weapons will grow dull and their ardour will be damped. If you lay siege to a town, you will exhaust your strength.\n\n3\\. Again, if the campaign is protracted, the resources of the State will not be equal to the strain.\n\n4\\. Now, when your weapons are dulled, your ardour damped, your strength exhausted and your treasure spent, other chieftains will spring up to take advantage of your extremity. Then no man, however wise, will be able to avert the consequences that must ensue.",
    "## Chapter II. WAGING WAR\n\n5\\. Thus, though we have heard of stupid haste in war, cleverness has never been seen associated with long delays.",
    "## Chapter II. WAGING WAR\n\n[This concise and difficult sentence is not well explained by any of the commentators. Ts’ao Kung, Li Ch’uan, Meng Shih, Tu Yu, Tu Mu and Mei Yao-ch’en have notes to the effect that a general, though naturally stupid, may nevertheless conquer through sheer force of rapidity. Ho Shih says: \"Haste may be stupid, but at any rate it saves expenditure of energy and treasure; protracted operations may be very clever, but they bring calamity in their train.\" Wang Hsi evades the difficulty by remarking: \"Lengthy operations mean an army growing old, wealth being expended, an empty exchequer and distress among the people; true cleverness insures against the occurrence of such calamities.\" Chang Yu says: \"So long as victory can be attained, stupid haste is preferable to clever dilatoriness.\" Now Sun Tzŭ says nothing whatever, except possibly by implication, about ill-considered haste being better than ingenious but lengthy operations. What he does say is something much more guarded, namely that, while speed may sometimes be injudicious, tardiness can never be anything but foolish—if only because it means impoverishment to the nation. In considering the point raised here by Sun Tzŭ, the classic example of Fabius Cunctator will inevitably occur to the mind. That general deliberately measured the endurance of Rome against that of Hannibals’s isolated army, because it seemed to him that the latter was more likely to suffer from a long campaign in a strange country. But it is quite a moot question whether his tactics would have proved successful in the long run. Their reversal it is true, led to Cannae; but this only establishes a negative presumption in their favour.]",
    "## Chapter II. WAGING WAR\n\n6\\. There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare.\n\n7\\. It is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the evils of war that can thoroughly understand the profitable way of carrying it on.\n\n[That is, with rapidity. Only one who knows the disastrous effects of a long war can realize the supreme importance of rapidity in bringing it to a close. Only two commentators seem to favour this interpretation, but it fits well into the logic of the context, whereas the rendering, \"He who does not know the evils of war cannot appreciate its benefits,\" is distinctly pointless.]\n\n8\\. The skilful soldier does not raise a second levy, neither are his supply-waggons loaded more than twice.\n\n[Once war is declared, he will not waste precious time in waiting for reinforcements, nor will he return his army back for fresh supplies, but crosses the enemy’s frontier without delay. This may seem an audacious policy to recommend, but with all great strategists, from Julius Caesar to Napoleon Bonaparte, the value of time—that is, being a little ahead of your opponent—has counted for more than either numerical superiority or the nicest calculations with regard to commissariat.]",
    "## Chapter II. WAGING WAR\n\n9\\. Bring war material with you from home, but forage on the enemy. Thus the army will have food enough for its needs.\n\n[The Chinese word translated here as \"war material\" literally means \"things to be used\", and is meant in the widest sense. It includes all the impedimenta of an army, apart from provisions.]\n\n10\\. Poverty of the State exchequer causes an army to be maintained by contributions from a distance. Contributing to maintain an army at a distance causes the people to be impoverished.\n\n[The beginning of this sentence does not balance properly with the next, though obviously intended to do so. The arrangement, moreover, is so awkward that I cannot help suspecting some corruption in the text. It never seems to occur to Chinese commentators that an emendation may be necessary for the sense, and we get no help from them there. The Chinese words Sun Tzŭ used to indicate the cause of the people’s impoverishment clearly have reference to some system by which the husbandmen sent their contributions of corn to the army direct. But why should it fall on them to maintain an army in this way, except because the State or Government is too poor to do so?]\n\n11\\. On the other hand, the proximity of an army causes prices to go up; and high prices cause the people’s substance to be drained away.\n\n[Wang Hsi says high prices occur before the army has left its own territory. Ts’ao Kung understands it of an army that has already crossed the frontier.]",
    "## Chapter II. WAGING WAR\n\n12\\. When their substance is drained away, the peasantry will be afflicted by heavy exactions.\n\n13, 14. With this loss of substance and exhaustion of strength, the homes of the people will be stripped bare, and three-tenths of their incomes will be dissipated;\n\n[Tu Mu and Wang Hsi agree that the people are not mulcted not of 3/10, but of 7/10, of their income. But this is hardly to be extracted from our text. Ho Shih has a characteristic tag: \"The _people_ being regarded as the essential part of the State, and _food_ as the people’s heaven, is it not right that those in authority should value and be careful of both?\"]\n\nwhile Government expenses for broken chariots, worn-out horses, breast-plates and helmets, bows and arrows, spears and shields, protective mantlets, draught-oxen and heavy waggons, will amount to four-tenths of its total revenue.\n\n15\\. Hence a wise general makes a point of foraging on the enemy. One cartload of the enemy’s provisions is equivalent to twenty of one’s own, and likewise a single _picul_ of his provender is equivalent to twenty from one’s own store.\n\n[Because twenty cartloads will be consumed in the process of transporting one cartload to the front. A _picul_ is a unit of measure equal to 133.3 pounds (65.5 kilograms).]",
    "## Chapter II. WAGING WAR\n\n16\\. Now in order to kill the enemy, our men must be roused to anger; that there may be advantage from defeating the enemy, they must have their rewards.\n\n[Tu Mu says: \"Rewards are necessary in order to make the soldiers see the advantage of beating the enemy; thus, when you capture spoils from the enemy, they must be used as rewards, so that all your men may have a keen desire to fight, each on his own account.\"]\n\n17\\. Therefore in chariot fighting, when ten or more chariots have been taken, those should be rewarded who took the first. Our own flags should be substituted for those of the enemy, and the chariots mingled and used in conjunction with ours. The captured soldiers should be kindly treated and kept.\n\n18\\. This is called, using the conquered foe to augment one’s own strength.\n\n19\\. In war, then, let your great object be victory, not lengthy campaigns.\n\n[As Ho Shih remarks: \"War is not a thing to be trifled with.\" Sun Tzŭ here reiterates the main lesson which this chapter is intended to enforce.\"]\n\n20\\. Thus it may be known that the leader of armies is the arbiter of the people’s fate, the man on whom it depends whether the nation shall be in peace or in peril.",
    "## Chapter III. ATTACK BY STRATAGEM",
    "1\\. Sun Tzŭ said: In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy’s country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good. So, too, it is better to capture an army entire than to destroy it, to capture a regiment, a detachment or a company entire than to destroy them.\n\n[The equivalent to an army corps, according to Ssu-ma Fa, consisted nominally of 12500 men; according to Ts’ao Kung, the equivalent of a regiment contained 500 men, the equivalent to a detachment consists from any number between 100 and 500, and the equivalent of a company contains from 5 to 100 men. For the last two, however, Chang Yu gives the exact figures of 100 and 5 respectively.]\n\n2\\. Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy’s resistance without fighting.\n\n[Here again, no modern strategist but will approve the words of the old Chinese general. Moltke’s greatest triumph, the capitulation of the huge French army at Sedan, was won practically without bloodshed.]",
    "## Chapter III. ATTACK BY STRATAGEM\n\n3\\. Thus the highest form of generalship is to baulk the enemy’s plans;\n\n[Perhaps the word \"balk\" falls short of expressing the full force of the Chinese word, which implies not an attitude of defence, whereby one might be content to foil the enemy’s stratagems one after another, but an active policy of counter-attack. Ho Shih puts this very clearly in his note: \"When the enemy has made a plan of attack against us, we must anticipate him by delivering our own attack first.\"]\n\nthe next best is to prevent the junction of the enemy’s forces;\n\n[Isolating him from his allies. We must not forget that Sun Tzŭ, in speaking of hostilities, always has in mind the numerous states or principalities into which the China of his day was split up.]\n\nthe next in order is to attack the enemy’s army in the field;\n\n[When he is already at full strength.]\n\nand the worst policy of all is to besiege walled cities.",
    "## Chapter III. ATTACK BY STRATAGEM\n\n4\\. The rule is, not to besiege walled cities if it can possibly be avoided.\n\n[Another sound piece of military theory. Had the Boers acted upon it in 1899, and refrained from dissipating their strength before Kimberley, Mafeking, or even Ladysmith, it is more than probable that they would have been masters of the situation before the British were ready seriously to oppose them.]\n\nThe preparation of mantlets, movable shelters, and various implements of war, will take up three whole months;\n\n[It is not quite clear what the Chinese word, here translated as \"mantlets\", described. Ts’ao Kung simply defines them as \"large shields,\" but we get a better idea of them from Li Ch’uan, who says they were to protect the heads of those who were assaulting the city walls at close quarters. This seems to suggest a sort of Roman _testudo_, ready made. Tu Mu says they were wheeled vehicles used in repelling attacks, but this is denied by Ch’en Hao. See _supra_ II. 14. The name is also applied to turrets on city walls. Of the \"movable shelters\" we get a fairly clear description from several commentators. They were wooden missile-proof structures on four wheels, propelled from within, covered over with raw hides, and used in sieges to convey parties of men to and from the walls, for the purpose of filling up the encircling moat with earth. Tu Mu adds that they are now called \"wooden donkeys.\"]",
    "## Chapter III. ATTACK BY STRATAGEM\n\nand the piling up of mounds over against the walls will take three months more.\n\n[These were great mounds or ramparts of earth heaped up to the level of the enemy’s walls in order to discover the weak points in the defence, and also to destroy the fortified turrets mentioned in the preceding note.]",
    "## Chapter III. ATTACK BY STRATAGEM\n\n5\\. The general, unable to control his irritation, will launch his men to the assault like swarming ants,\n\n[This vivid simile of Ts’ao Kung is taken from the spectacle of an army of ants climbing a wall. The meaning is that the general, losing patience at the long delay, may make a premature attempt to storm the place before his engines of war are ready.]\n\nwith the result that one-third of his men are slain, while the town still remains untaken. Such are the disastrous effects of a siege.\n\n[We are reminded of the terrible losses of the Japanese before Port Arthur, in the most recent siege which history has to record.]\n\n6\\. Therefore the skilful leader subdues the enemy’s troops without any fighting; he captures their cities without laying siege to them; he overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field.\n\n[Chia Lin notes that he only overthrows the Government, but does no harm to individuals. The classical instance is Wu Wang, who after having put an end to the Yin dynasty was acclaimed \"Father and mother of the people.\"]\n\n7\\. With his forces intact he will dispute the mastery of the Empire, and thus, without losing a man, his triumph will be complete.\n\n[Owing to the double meanings in the Chinese text, the latter part of the sentence is susceptible of quite a different meaning: \"And thus, the weapon not being blunted by use, its keenness remains perfect.\"]\n\nThis is the method of attacking by stratagem.",
    "## Chapter III. ATTACK BY STRATAGEM\n\n8\\. It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the enemy’s one, to surround him; if five to one, to attack him;\n\n[Straightway, without waiting for any further advantage.]\n\nif twice as numerous, to divide our army into two.\n\n[Tu Mu takes exception to the saying; and at first sight, indeed, it appears to violate a fundamental principle of war. Ts’ao Kung, however, gives a clue to Sun Tzŭ’s meaning: \"Being two to the enemy’s one, we may use one part of our army in the regular way, and the other for some special diversion.\" Chang Yu thus further elucidates the point: \"If our force is twice as numerous as that of the enemy, it should be split up into two divisions, one to meet the enemy in front, and one to fall upon his rear; if he replies to the frontal attack, he may be crushed from behind; if to the rearward attack, he may be crushed in front.\" This is what is meant by saying that ‘one part may be used in the regular way, and the other for some special diversion.’ Tu Mu does not understand that dividing one’s army is simply an irregular, just as concentrating it is the regular, strategical method, and he is too hasty in calling this a mistake.\"]",
    "## Chapter III. ATTACK BY STRATAGEM\n\n9\\. If equally matched, we can offer battle;\n\n[Li Ch’uan, followed by Ho Shih, gives the following paraphrase: \"If attackers and attacked are equally matched in strength, only the able general will fight.\"]\n\nif slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy;\n\n[The meaning, \"we can _watch_ the enemy,\" is certainly a great improvement on the above; but unfortunately there appears to be no very good authority for the variant. Chang Yu reminds us that the saying only applies if the other factors are equal; a small difference in numbers is often more than counterbalanced by superior energy and discipline.]\n\nif quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him.\n\n10\\. Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force, in the end it must be captured by the larger force.\n\n11\\. Now the general is the bulwark of the State: if the bulwark is complete at all points; the State will be strong; if the bulwark is defective, the State will be weak.\n\n[As Li Ch’uan tersely puts it: \"Gap indicates deficiency; if the general’s ability is not perfect (i.e. if he is not thoroughly versed in his profession), his army will lack strength.\"]\n\n12\\. There are three ways in which a ruler can bring misfortune upon his army:—",
    "## Chapter III. ATTACK BY STRATAGEM\n\n13\\. (1) By commanding the army to advance or to retreat, being ignorant of the fact that it cannot obey. This is called hobbling the army.\n\n[Li Ch’uan adds the comment: \"It is like tying together the legs of a thoroughbred, so that it is unable to gallop.\" One would naturally think of \"the ruler\" in this passage as being at home, and trying to direct the movements of his army from a distance. But the commentators understand just the reverse, and quote the saying of T’ai Kung: \"A kingdom should not be governed from without, and army should not be directed from within.\" Of course it is true that, during an engagement, or when in close touch with the enemy, the general should not be in the thick of his own troops, but a little distance apart. Otherwise, he will be liable to misjudge the position as a whole, and give wrong orders.]\n\n14\\. (2) By attempting to govern an army in the same way as he administers a kingdom, being ignorant of the conditions which obtain in an army. This causes restlessness in the soldier’s minds.\n\n[Ts’ao Kung’s note is, freely translated: \"The military sphere and the civil sphere are wholly distinct; you can’t handle an army in kid gloves.\" And Chang Yu says: \"Humanity and justice are the principles on which to govern a state, but not an army; opportunism and flexibility, on the other hand, are military rather than civil virtues to assimilate the governing of an army\"—to that of a State, understood.]",
    "## Chapter III. ATTACK BY STRATAGEM\n\n15\\. (3) By employing the officers of his army without discrimination,\n\n[That is, he is not careful to use the right man in the right place.]\n\nthrough ignorance of the military principle of adaptation to circumstances. This shakes the confidence of the soldiers.\n\n[I follow Mei Yao-ch’en here. The other commentators refer not to the ruler, as in §§ 13, 14, but to the officers he employs. Thus Tu Yu says: \"If a general is ignorant of the principle of adaptability, he must not be entrusted with a position of authority.\" Tu Mu quotes: \"The skilful employer of men will employ the wise man, the brave man, the covetous man, and the stupid man. For the wise man delights in establishing his merit, the brave man likes to show his courage in action, the covetous man is quick at seizing advantages, and the stupid man has no fear of death.\"]\n\n16\\. But when the army is restless and distrustful, trouble is sure to come from the other feudal princes. This is simply bringing anarchy into the army, and flinging victory away.",
    "## Chapter III. ATTACK BY STRATAGEM\n\n17\\. Thus we may know that there are five essentials for victory: (1) He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight.\n\n[Chang Yu says: If he can fight, he advances and takes the offensive; if he cannot fight, he retreats and remains on the defensive. He will invariably conquer who knows whether it is right to take the offensive or the defensive.]\n\n(2) He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces.\n\n[This is not merely the general’s ability to estimate numbers correctly, as Li Ch’uan and others make out. Chang Yu expounds the saying more satisfactorily: \"By applying the art of war, it is possible with a lesser force to defeat a greater, and _vice versa_. The secret lies in an eye for locality, and in not letting the right moment slip. Thus Wu Tzŭ says: ‘With a superior force, make for easy ground; with an inferior one, make for difficult ground.’\"]\n\n(3) He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks.\n\n(4) He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared.\n\n(5) He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign.",
    "## Chapter III. ATTACK BY STRATAGEM\n\n[Tu Yu quotes Wang Tzŭ as saying: \"It is the sovereign’s function to give broad instructions, but to decide on battle it is the function of the general.\" It is needless to dilate on the military disasters which have been caused by undue interference with operations in the field on the part of the home government. Napoleon undoubtedly owed much of his extraordinary success to the fact that he was not hampered by central authority.]\n\nVictory lies in the knowledge of these five points.\n\n[Literally, “These five things are knowledge of the principle of victory.”]",
    "## Chapter III. ATTACK BY STRATAGEM\n\n18\\. Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat.\n\n[Li Ch’uan cites the case of Fu Chien, prince of Ch’in, who in 383 A.D. marched with a vast army against the Chin Emperor. When warned not to despise an enemy who could command the services of such men as Hsieh An and Huan Ch’ung, he boastfully replied: \"I have the population of eight provinces at my back, infantry and horsemen to the number of one million; why, they could dam up the Yangtsze River itself by merely throwing their whips into the stream. What danger have I to fear?\" Nevertheless, his forces were soon after disastrously routed at the Fei River, and he was obliged to beat a hasty retreat.]\n\nIf you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.\n\n[Chang Yu said: \"Knowing the enemy enables you to take the offensive, knowing yourself enables you to stand on the defensive.\" He adds: \"Attack is the secret of defence; defence is the planning of an attack.\" It would be hard to find a better epitome of the root-principle of war.]",
    "## Chapter IV. TACTICAL DISPOSITIONS\n\n[Ts’ao Kung explains the Chinese meaning of the words for the title of this chapter: \"marching and countermarching on the part of the two armies with a view to discovering each other’s condition.\" Tu Mu says: \"It is through the dispositions of an army that its condition may be discovered. Conceal your dispositions, and your condition will remain secret, which leads to victory; show your dispositions, and your condition will become patent, which leads to defeat.\" Wang Hsi remarks that the good general can \"secure success by modifying his tactics to meet those of the enemy.\"]",
    "1\\. Sun Tzŭ said: The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy.\n\n2\\. To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.\n\n[That is, of course, by a mistake on the enemy’s part.]\n\n3\\. Thus the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat,\n\n[Chang Yu says this is done, \"By concealing the disposition of his troops, covering up his tracks, and taking unremitting precautions.\"]\n\nbut cannot make certain of defeating the enemy.\n\n4\\. Hence the saying: One may _know_ how to conquer without being able to _do_ it.\n\n5\\. Security against defeat implies defensive tactics; ability to defeat the enemy means taking the offensive.\n\n[I retain the sense found in a similar passage in §§ 1-3, in spite of the fact that the commentators are all against me. The meaning they give, \"He who cannot conquer takes the defensive,\" is plausible enough.]\n\n6\\. Standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength; attacking, a superabundance of strength.",
    "## Chapter IV. TACTICAL DISPOSITIONS\n\n7\\. The general who is skilled in defence hides in the most secret recesses of the earth;\n\n[Literally, \"hides under the ninth earth,\" which is a metaphor indicating the utmost secrecy and concealment, so that the enemy may not know his whereabouts.\"]\n\nhe who is skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of heaven.\n\n[Another metaphor, implying that he falls on his adversary like a thunderbolt, against which there is no time to prepare. This is the opinion of most of the commentators.]\n\nThus on the one hand we have ability to protect ourselves; on the other, a victory that is complete.\n\n8\\. To see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is not the acme of excellence.\n\n[As Ts’ao Kung remarks, \"the thing is to see the plant before it has germinated,\" to foresee the event before the action has begun. Li Ch’uan alludes to the story of Han Hsin who, when about to attack the vastly superior army of Chao, which was strongly entrenched in the city of Ch’eng-an, said to his officers: \"Gentlemen, we are going to annihilate the enemy, and shall meet again at dinner.\" The officers hardly took his words seriously, and gave a very dubious assent. But Han Hsin had already worked out in his mind the details of a clever stratagem, whereby, as he foresaw, he was able to capture the city and inflict a crushing defeat on his adversary.\"]",
    "## Chapter IV. TACTICAL DISPOSITIONS\n\n9\\. Neither is it the acme of excellence if you fight and conquer and the whole Empire says, \"Well done!\"\n\n[True excellence being, as Tu Mu says: \"To plan secretly, to move surreptitiously, to foil the enemy’s intentions and balk his schemes, so that at last the day may be won without shedding a drop of blood.\" Sun Tzŭ reserves his approbation for things that\n\n\"the world’s coarse thumb  \nAnd finger fail to plumb.\"\n\n10\\. To lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength;\n\n[\"Autumn hair\" is explained as the fur of a hare, which is finest in autumn, when it begins to grow afresh. The phrase is a very common one in Chinese writers.]\n\nto see sun and moon is no sign of sharp sight; to hear the noise of thunder is no sign of a quick ear.\n\n[Ho Shih gives as real instances of strength, sharp sight and quick hearing: Wu Huo, who could lift a tripod weighing 250 stone; Li Chu, who at a distance of a hundred paces could see objects no bigger than a mustard seed; and Shih K’uang, a blind musician who could hear the footsteps of a mosquito.]\n\n11\\. What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins, but excels in winning with ease.\n\n[The last half is literally \"one who, conquering, excels in easy conquering.\" Mei Yao-ch’en says: \"He who only sees the obvious, wins his battles with difficulty; he who looks below the surface of things, wins with ease.\"]",
    "## Chapter IV. TACTICAL DISPOSITIONS\n\n12\\. Hence his victories bring him neither reputation for wisdom nor credit for courage.\n\n[Tu Mu explains this very well: \"Inasmuch as his victories are gained over circumstances that have not come to light, the world as large knows nothing of them, and he wins no reputation for wisdom; inasmuch as the hostile state submits before there has been any bloodshed, he receives no credit for courage.\"]\n\n13\\. He wins his battles by making no mistakes.\n\n[Ch’en Hao says: \"He plans no superfluous marches, he devises no futile attacks.\" The connection of ideas is thus explained by Chang Yu: \"One who seeks to conquer by sheer strength, clever though he may be at winning pitched battles, is also liable on occasion to be vanquished; whereas he who can look into the future and discern conditions that are not yet manifest, will never make a blunder and therefore invariably win.\"]\n\nMaking no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory, for it means conquering an enemy that is already defeated.\n\n14\\. Hence the skilful fighter puts himself into a position which makes defeat impossible, and does not miss the moment for defeating the enemy.\n\n[A \"counsel of perfection\" as Tu Mu truly observes. \"Position\" need not be confined to the actual ground occupied by the troops. It includes all the arrangements and preparations which a wise general will make to increase the safety of his army.]",
    "## Chapter IV. TACTICAL DISPOSITIONS\n\n15\\. Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory.\n\n[Ho Shih thus expounds the paradox: \"In warfare, first lay plans which will ensure victory, and then lead your army to battle; if you will not begin with stratagem but rely on brute strength alone, victory will no longer be assured.\"]\n\n16\\. The consummate leader cultivates the moral law, and strictly adheres to method and discipline; thus it is in his power to control success.\n\n17\\. In respect of military method, we have, firstly, Measurement; secondly, Estimation of quantity; thirdly, Calculation; fourthly, Balancing of chances; fifthly, Victory.",
    "## Chapter IV. TACTICAL DISPOSITIONS\n\n18\\. Measurement owes its existence to Earth; Estimation of quantity to Measurement; Calculation to Estimation of quantity; Balancing of chances to Calculation; and Victory to Balancing of chances.\n\n[It is not easy to distinguish the four terms very clearly in the Chinese. The first seems to be surveying and measurement of the ground, which enable us to form an estimate of the enemy’s strength, and to make calculations based on the data thus obtained; we are thus led to a general weighing-up, or comparison of the enemy’s chances with our own; if the latter turn the scale, then victory ensues. The chief difficulty lies in third term, which in the Chinese some commentators take as a calculation of _numbers_, thereby making it nearly synonymous with the second term. Perhaps the second term should be thought of as a consideration of the enemy’s general position or condition, while the third term is the estimate of his numerical strength. On the other hand, Tu Mu says: \"The question of relative strength having been settled, we can bring the varied resources of cunning into play.\" Ho Shih seconds this interpretation, but weakens it. However, it points to the third term as being a calculation of numbers.]",
    "## Chapter IV. TACTICAL DISPOSITIONS\n\n19\\. A victorious army opposed to a routed one, is as a pound’s weight placed in the scale against a single grain.\n\n[Literally, \"a victorious army is like an _i_ (20 oz.) weighed against a _shu_ (1/24 oz.); a routed army is a _shu_ weighed against an _i_.\" The point is simply the enormous advantage which a disciplined force, flushed with victory, has over one demoralized by defeat. Legge, in his note on Mencius, I. 2. ix. 2, makes the _i_ to be 24 Chinese ounces, and corrects Chu Hsi’s statement that it equaled 20 oz. only. But Li Ch’uan of the T’ang dynasty here gives the same figure as Chu Hsi.]\n\n20\\. The onrush of a conquering force is like the bursting of pent-up waters into a chasm a thousand fathoms deep. So much for tactical dispositions.",
    "## Chapter V. ENERGY",
    "1\\. Sun Tzŭ said: The control of a large force is the same principle as the control of a few men: it is merely a question of dividing up their numbers.\n\n[That is, cutting up the army into regiments, companies, etc., with subordinate officers in command of each. Tu Mu reminds us of Han Hsin’s famous reply to the first Han Emperor, who once said to him: \"How large an army do you think I could lead?\" \"Not more than 100,000 men, your Majesty.\" \"And you?\" asked the Emperor. \"Oh!\" he answered, \"the more the better.\"]\n\n2\\. Fighting with a large army under your command is nowise different from fighting with a small one: it is merely a question of instituting signs and signals.",
    "## Chapter V. ENERGY\n\n3\\. To ensure that your whole host may withstand the brunt of the enemy’s attack and remain unshaken—this is effected by manœuvers direct and indirect.",
    "## Chapter V. ENERGY\n\n[We now come to one of the most interesting parts of Sun Tzŭ’s treatise, the discussion of the _cheng_ and the _ch’i_.\" As it is by no means easy to grasp the full significance of these two terms, or to render them consistently by good English equivalents; it may be as well to tabulate some of the commentators’ remarks on the subject before proceeding further. Li Ch’uan: \"Facing the enemy is _cheng_, making lateral diversion is _ch’i_. Chia Lin: \"In presence of the enemy, your troops should be arrayed in normal fashion, but in order to secure victory abnormal manœuvers must be employed.\" Mei Yao-ch’en: \"_Ch’i_ is active, _cheng_ is passive; passivity means waiting for an opportunity, activity brings the victory itself.\" Ho Shih: \"We must cause the enemy to regard our straightforward attack as one that is secretly designed, and vice versa; thus _cheng_ may also be _ch’i_, and _ch’i_ may also be _cheng_.\" He instances the famous exploit of Han Hsin, who when marching ostensibly against Lin-chin (now Chao-i in Shensi), suddenly threw a large force across the Yellow River in wooden tubs, utterly disconcerting his opponent. [Ch’ien Han Shu, ch. 3.] Here, we are told, the march on Lin-chin was _cheng_, and the surprise manœuver was _ch’i_.\" Chang Yu gives the following summary of opinions on the words: \"Military writers do not agree with regard to the meaning of _ch’i_ and _cheng_. Wei Liao Tzŭ [4th cent. B.C.] says: ‘Direct warfare favours frontal attacks, indirect warfare attacks from the rear.’ Ts’ao Kung says: ‘Going straight out to join battle is a direct operation; appearing on the enemy’s rear is an indirect manœuver.’ Li Wei-kung [6th and 7th cent. A.D.] says: ‘In war, to march straight ahead is _cheng_; turning movements, on the other hand, are _ch’i_.’ These writers simply regard _cheng_ as _cheng_, and _ch’i_ as _ch’i_; they do not note that the two are mutually interchangeable and run into each other like the two sides of a circle [see infra, § 11]. A comment on the T’ang Emperor T’ai Tsung goes to the root of the matter: ‘A _ch’i_ manœuver may be _cheng_, if we make the enemy look upon it as _cheng_; then our real attack will be _ch’i_, and vice versa. The whole secret lies in confusing the enemy, so that he cannot fathom our real intent.’\" To put it perhaps a little more clearly: any attack or other operation is _cheng_, on which the enemy has had his attention fixed; whereas that is _ch’i_,\" which takes him by surprise or comes from an unexpected quarter. If the enemy perceives a movement which is meant to be _ch’i_,\" it immediately becomes _cheng_.\"]",
    "## Chapter V. ENERGY\n\n4\\. That the impact of your army may be like a grindstone dashed against an egg—this is effected by the science of weak points and strong.\n\n5\\. In all fighting, the direct method may be used for joining battle, but indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory.\n\n[Chang Yu says: \"Steadily develop indirect tactics, either by pounding the enemy’s flanks or falling on his rear.\" A brilliant example of \"indirect tactics\" which decided the fortunes of a campaign was Lord Roberts’ night march round the Peiwar Kotal in the second Afghan war. [1]\n\n6\\. Indirect tactics, efficiently applied, are inexhausible as Heaven and Earth, unending as the flow of rivers and streams; like the sun and moon, they end but to begin anew; like the four seasons, they pass away but to return once more.\n\n[Tu Yu and Chang Yu understand this of the permutations of _ch’i_ and _cheng_. But at present Sun Tzŭ is not speaking of _cheng_ at all, unless, indeed, we suppose with Cheng Yu-hsien that a clause relating to it has fallen out of the text. Of course, as has already been pointed out, the two are so inextricably interwoven in all military operations, that they cannot really be considered apart. Here we simply have an expression, in figurative language, of the almost infinite resource of a great leader.]\n\n7\\. There are not more than five musical notes, yet the combinations of these five give rise to more melodies than can ever be heard.",
    "## Chapter V. ENERGY\n\n8\\. There are not more than five primary colours (blue, yellow, red, white, and black), yet in combination they produce more hues than can ever be seen.\n\n9 There are not more than five cardinal tastes (sour, acrid, salt, sweet, bitter), yet combinations of them yield more flavours than can ever be tasted.\n\n10\\. In battle, there are not more than two methods of attack—the direct and the indirect; yet these two in combination give rise to an endless series of manœuvers.\n\n11\\. The direct and the indirect lead on to each other in turn. It is like moving in a circle—you never come to an end. Who can exhaust the possibilities of their combination?\n\n12\\. The onset of troops is like the rush of a torrent which will even roll stones along in its course.",
    "## Chapter V. ENERGY\n\n13\\. The quality of decision is like the well-timed swoop of a falcon which enables it to strike and destroy its victim.\n\n[The Chinese here is tricky and a certain key word in the context it is used defies the best efforts of the translator. Tu Mu defines this word as \"the measurement or estimation of distance.\" But this meaning does not quite fit the illustrative simile in §. 15. Applying this definition to the falcon, it seems to me to denote that instinct of _self-restraint_ which keeps the bird from swooping on its quarry until the right moment, together with the power of judging when the right moment has arrived. The analogous quality in soldiers is the highly important one of being able to reserve their fire until the very instant at which it will be most effective. When the \"Victory\" went into action at Trafalgar at hardly more than drifting pace, she was for several minutes exposed to a storm of shot and shell before replying with a single gun. Nelson coolly waited until he was within close range, when the broadside he brought to bear worked fearful havoc on the enemy’s nearest ships.]",
    "## Chapter V. ENERGY\n\n14\\. Therefore the good fighter will be terrible in his onset, and prompt in his decision.\n\n[The word \"decision\" would have reference to the measurement of distance mentioned above, letting the enemy get near before striking. But I cannot help thinking that Sun Tzŭ meant to use the word in a figurative sense comparable to our own idiom \"short and sharp.\" Cf. Wang Hsi’s note, which after describing the falcon’s mode of attack, proceeds: \"This is just how the ‘psychological moment’ should be seized in war.\"]\n\n15\\. Energy may be likened to the bending of a crossbow; decision, to the releasing of the trigger.\n\n[None of the commentators seem to grasp the real point of the simile of energy and the force stored up in the bent cross-bow until released by the finger on the trigger.]\n\n16\\. Amid the turmoil and tumult of battle, there may be seeming disorder and yet no real disorder at all; amid confusion and chaos, your array may be without head or tail, yet it will be proof against defeat.\n\n[Mei Yao-ch’en says: \"The subdivisions of the army having been previously fixed, and the various signals agreed upon, the separating and joining, the dispersing and collecting which will take place in the course of a battle, may give the appearance of disorder when no real disorder is possible. Your formation may be without head or tail, your dispositions all topsy-turvy, and yet a rout of your forces quite out of the question.\"]",
    "## Chapter V. ENERGY\n\n17\\. Simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline; simulated fear postulates courage; simulated weakness postulates strength.\n\n[In order to make the translation intelligible, it is necessary to tone down the sharply paradoxical form of the original. Ts’ao Kung throws out a hint of the meaning in his brief note: \"These things all serve to destroy formation and conceal one’s condition.\" But Tu Mu is the first to put it quite plainly: \"If you wish to feign confusion in order to lure the enemy on, you must first have perfect discipline; if you wish to display timidity in order to entrap the enemy, you must have extreme courage; if you wish to parade your weakness in order to make the enemy over-confident, you must have exceeding strength.\"]",
    "## Chapter V. ENERGY\n\n18\\. Hiding order beneath the cloak of disorder is simply a question of subdivision;\n\n[See _supra_, § 1.]\n\nconcealing courage under a show of timidity presupposes a fund of latent energy;\n\n[The commentators strongly understand a certain Chinese word here differently than anywhere else in this chapter. Thus Tu Mu says: \"seeing that we are favourably circumstanced and yet make no move, the enemy will believe that we are really afraid.\"]\n\nmasking strength with weakness is to be effected by tactical dispositions.\n\n[Chang Yu relates the following anecdote of Kao Tsu, the first Han Emperor: “Wishing to crush the Hsiung-nu, he sent out spies to report on their condition. But the Hsiung-nu, forewarned, carefully concealed all their able-bodied men and well-fed horses, and only allowed infirm soldiers and emaciated cattle to be seen. The result was that spies one and all recommended the Emperor to deliver his attack. Lou Ching alone opposed them, saying: ‘When two countries go to war, they are naturally inclined to make an ostentatious display of their strength. Yet our spies have seen nothing but old age and infirmity. This is surely some _ruse_ on the part of the enemy, and it would be unwise for us to attack.’ The Emperor, however, disregarding this advice, fell into the trap and found himself surrounded at Po-teng.”]",
    "## Chapter V. ENERGY\n\n19\\. Thus one who is skilful at keeping the enemy on the move maintains deceitful appearances, according to which the enemy will act.",
    "## Chapter V. ENERGY\n\n[Ts’ao Kung’s note is \"Make a display of weakness and want.\" Tu Mu says: \"If our force happens to be superior to the enemy’s, weakness may be simulated in order to lure him on; but if inferior, he must be led to believe that we are strong, in order that he may keep off. In fact, all the enemy’s movements should be determined by the signs that we choose to give him.\" Note the following anecdote of Sun Pin, a descendent of Sun Wu: In 341 B.C., the Ch’i State being at war with Wei, sent T’ien Chi and Sun Pin against the general P’ang Chuan, who happened to be a deadly personal enemy of the later. Sun Pin said: \"The Ch’i State has a reputation for cowardice, and therefore our adversary despises us. Let us turn this circumstance to account.\" Accordingly, when the army had crossed the border into Wei territory, he gave orders to show 100,000 fires on the first night, 50,000 on the next, and the night after only 20,000. P’ang Chuan pursued them hotly, saying to himself: \"I knew these men of Ch’i were cowards: their numbers have already fallen away by more than half.\" In his retreat, Sun Pin came to a narrow defile, which he calculated that his pursuers would reach after dark. Here he had a tree stripped of its bark, and inscribed upon it the words: \"Under this tree shall P’ang Chuan die.\" Then, as night began to fall, he placed a strong body of archers in ambush near by, with orders to shoot directly if they saw a light. Later on, P’ang Chuan arrived at the spot, and noticing the tree, struck a light in order to read what was written on it. His body was immediately riddled by a volley of arrows, and his whole army thrown into confusion. [The above is Tu Mu’s version of the story; the _Shih Chi_, less dramatically but probably with more historical truth, makes P’ang Chuan cut his own throat with an exclamation of despair, after the rout of his army.] ]",
    "## Chapter V. ENERGY\n\nHe sacrifices something, that the enemy may snatch at it.",
    "## Chapter V. ENERGY\n\n20\\. By holding out baits, he keeps him on the march; then with a body of picked men he lies in wait for him.\n\n[With an emendation suggested by Li Ching, this then reads, \"He lies in wait with the main body of his troops.\"]\n\n21\\. The clever combatant looks to the effect of combined energy, and does not require too much from individuals.\n\n[Tu Mu says: \"He first of all considers the power of his army in the bulk; afterwards he takes individual talent into account, and uses each men according to his capabilities. He does not demand perfection from the untalented.\"]\n\nHence his ability to pick out the right men and utilise combined energy.\n\n22\\. When he utilises combined energy, his fighting men become as it were like unto rolling logs or stones. For it is the nature of a log or stone to remain motionless on level ground, and to move when on a slope; if four-cornered, to come to a standstill, but if round-shaped, to go rolling down.\n\n[Ts’au Kung calls this \"the use of natural or inherent power.\"]\n\n23\\. Thus the energy developed by good fighting men is as the momentum of a round stone rolled down a mountain thousands of feet in height. So much on the subject of energy.\n\n[The chief lesson of this chapter, in Tu Mu’s opinion, is the paramount importance in war of rapid evolutions and sudden rushes. \"Great results,\" he adds, \"can thus be achieved with small forces.\"]\n\n[1] \"Forty-one Years in India,\" chapter 46.",
    "## Chapter VI. WEAK POINTS AND STRONG\n\n[Chang Yu attempts to explain the sequence of chapters as follows: \"Chapter IV, on Tactical Dispositions, treated of the offensive and the defensive; chapter V, on Energy, dealt with direct and indirect methods. The good general acquaints himself first with the theory of attack and defence, and then turns his attention to direct and indirect methods. He studies the art of varying and combining these two methods before proceeding to the subject of weak and strong points. For the use of direct or indirect methods arises out of attack and defence, and the perception of weak and strong points depends again on the above methods. Hence the present chapter comes immediately after the chapter on Energy.\"]",
    "1\\. Sun Tzŭ said: Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle, will arrive exhausted.\n\n2\\. Therefore the clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy, but does not allow the enemy’s will to be imposed on him.\n\n[One mark of a great soldier is that he fight on his own terms or fights not at all. [1] ]\n\n3\\. By holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy to approach of his own accord; or, by inflicting damage, he can make it impossible for the enemy to draw near.\n\n[In the first case, he will entice him with a bait; in the second, he will strike at some important point which the enemy will have to defend.]\n\n4\\. If the enemy is taking his ease, he can harass him;\n\n[This passage may be cited as evidence against Mei Yao- Ch’en’s interpretation of I. § 23.]\n\nif well supplied with food, he can starve him out; if quietly encamped, he can force him to move.\n\n5\\. Appear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend; march swiftly to places where you are not expected.\n\n6\\. An army may march great distances without distress, if it marches through country where the enemy is not.\n\n[Ts’ao Kung sums up very well: \"Emerge from the void [q.d. like \"a bolt from the blue\"], strike at vulnerable points, shun places that are defended, attack in unexpected quarters.\"]",
    "## Chapter VI. WEAK POINTS AND STRONG\n\n7\\. You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack places which are undefended.\n\n[Wang Hsi explains \"undefended places\" as \"weak points; that is to say, where the general is lacking in capacity, or the soldiers in spirit; where the walls are not strong enough, or the precautions not strict enough; where relief comes too late, or provisions are too scanty, or the defenders are variance amongst themselves.\"]\n\nYou can ensure the safety of your defence if you only hold positions that cannot be attacked.",
    "## Chapter VI. WEAK POINTS AND STRONG\n\n[_I.e._, where there are none of the weak points mentioned above. There is rather a nice point involved in the interpretation of this later clause. Tu Mu, Ch’en Hao, and Mei Yao-ch’en assume the meaning to be: \"In order to make your defence quite safe, you must defend _even_ those places that are not likely to be attacked;\" and Tu Mu adds: \"How much more, then, those that will be attacked.\" Taken thus, however, the clause balances less well with the preceding—always a consideration in the highly antithetical style which is natural to the Chinese. Chang Yu, therefore, seems to come nearer the mark in saying: \"He who is skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of heaven [see IV. § 7], making it impossible for the enemy to guard against him. This being so, the places that I shall attack are precisely those that the enemy cannot defend…. He who is skilled in defence hides in the most secret recesses of the earth, making it impossible for the enemy to estimate his whereabouts. This being so, the places that I shall hold are precisely those that the enemy cannot attack.\"]",
    "## Chapter VI. WEAK POINTS AND STRONG\n\n8\\. Hence that general is skilful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend; and he is skilful in defence whose opponent does not know what to attack.\n\n[An aphorism which puts the whole art of war in a nutshell.]\n\n9\\. O divine art of subtlety and secrecy! Through you we learn to be invisible, through you inaudible;\n\n[Literally, \"without form or sound,\" but it is said of course with reference to the enemy.]\n\nand hence we can hold the enemy’s fate in our hands.\n\n10\\. You may advance and be absolutely irresistible, if you make for the enemy’s weak points; you may retire and be safe from pursuit if your movements are more rapid than those of the enemy.\n\n11\\. If we wish to fight, the enemy can be forced to an engagement even though he be sheltered behind a high rampart and a deep ditch. All we need do is attack some other place that he will be obliged to relieve.\n\n[Tu Mu says: \"If the enemy is the invading party, we can cut his line of communications and occupy the roads by which he will have to return; if we are the invaders, we may direct our attack against the sovereign himself.\" It is clear that Sun Tzŭ, unlike certain generals in the late Boer war, was no believer in frontal attacks.]",
    "## Chapter VI. WEAK POINTS AND STRONG\n\n12\\. If we do not wish to fight, we can prevent the enemy from engaging us even though the lines of our encampment be merely traced out on the ground. All we need do is to throw something odd and unaccountable in his way.\n\n[This extremely concise expression is intelligibly paraphrased by Chia Lin: \"even though we have constructed neither wall nor ditch.\" Li Ch’uan says: \"we puzzle him by strange and unusual dispositions;\" and Tu Mu finally clinches the meaning by three illustrative anecdotes—one of Chu-ko Liang, who when occupying Yang-p’ing and about to be attacked by Ssu-ma I, suddenly struck his colors, stopped the beating of the drums, and flung open the city gates, showing only a few men engaged in sweeping and sprinkling the ground. This unexpected proceeding had the intended effect; for Ssu-ma I, suspecting an ambush, actually drew off his army and retreated. What Sun Tzŭ is advocating here, therefore, is nothing more nor less than the timely use of \"bluff.\"]",
    "## Chapter VI. WEAK POINTS AND STRONG\n\n13\\. By discovering the enemy’s dispositions and remaining invisible ourselves, we can keep our forces concentrated, while the enemy’s must be divided.\n\n[The conclusion is perhaps not very obvious, but Chang Yu (after Mei Yao-ch’en) rightly explains it thus: \"If the enemy’s dispositions are visible, we can make for him in one body; whereas, our own dispositions being kept secret, the enemy will be obliged to divide his forces in order to guard against attack from every quarter.\"]\n\n14\\. We can form a single united body, while the enemy must split up into fractions. Hence there will be a whole pitted against separate parts of a whole, which means that we shall be many to the enemy’s few.\n\n15\\. And if we are able thus to attack an inferior force with a superior one, our opponents will be in dire straits.\n\n16\\. The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known; for then the enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several different points;\n\n[Sheridan once explained the reason of General Grant’s victories by saying that \"while his opponents were kept fully employed wondering what he was going to do, _he_ was thinking most of what he was going to do himself.\"]\n\nand his forces being thus distributed in many directions, the numbers we shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately few.",

For should the enemy strengthen his van, he will weaken his rear; should he strengthen his rear, he will weaken his van; should he strengthen his left, he will weaken his right; should he strengthen his right, he will weaken his left. If he sends reinforcements everywhere, he will everywhere be weak.\n\n[In Frederick the Great’s _Instructions to his Generals_ we read: \"A defensive war is apt to betray us into too frequent detachment. Those generals who have had but little experience attempt to protect every point, while those who are better acquainted with their profession, having only the capital object in view, guard against a decisive blow, and acquiesce in small misfortunes to avoid greater.\"]\n\n18\\. Numerical weakness comes from having to prepare against possible attacks; numerical strength, from compelling our adversary to make these preparations against us.\n\n[The highest generalship, in Col. Henderson’s words, is \"to compel the enemy to disperse his army, and then to concentrate superior force against each fraction in turn.\"]",
    "## Chapter VI. WEAK POINTS AND STRONG\n\n19\\. Knowing the place and the time of the coming battle, we may concentrate from the greatest distances in order to fight.\n\n[What Sun Tzŭ evidently has in mind is that nice calculation of distances and that masterly employment of strategy which enable a general to divide his army for the purpose of a long and rapid march, and afterwards to effect a junction at precisely the right spot and the right hour in order to confront the enemy in overwhelming strength. Among many such successful junctions which military history records, one of the most dramatic and decisive was the appearance of Blucher just at the critical moment on the field of Waterloo.]",
    "## Chapter VI. WEAK POINTS AND STRONG\n\n20\\. But if neither time nor place be known, then the left wing will be impotent to succour the right, the right equally impotent to succour the left, the van unable to relieve the rear, or the rear to support the van. How much more so if the furthest portions of the army are anything under a hundred _li_ apart, and even the nearest are separated by several _li_!\n\n[The Chinese of this last sentence is a little lacking in precision, but the mental picture we are required to draw is probably that of an army advancing towards a given rendezvous in separate columns, each of which has orders to be there on a fixed date. If the general allows the various detachments to proceed at haphazard, without precise instructions as to the time and place of meeting, the enemy will be able to annihilate the army in detail. Chang Yu’s note may be worth quoting here: \"If we do not know the place where our opponents mean to concentrate or the day on which they will join battle, our unity will be forfeited through our preparations for defence, and the positions we hold will be insecure. Suddenly happening upon a powerful foe, we shall be brought to battle in a flurried condition, and no mutual support will be possible between wings, vanguard or rear, especially if there is any great distance between the foremost and hindmost divisions of the army.\"]",
    "## Chapter VI. WEAK POINTS AND STRONG\n\n21\\. Though according to my estimate the soldiers of Yüeh exceed our own in number, that shall advantage them nothing in the matter of victory. I say then that victory can be achieved.\n\n[Alas for these brave words! The long feud between the two states ended in 473 B.C. with the total defeat of Wu by Kou Chien and its incorporation in Yüeh. This was doubtless long after Sun Tzŭ’s death. With his present assertion compare IV. § 4. Chang Yu is the only one to point out the seeming discrepancy, which he thus goes on to explain: \"In the chapter on Tactical Dispositions it is said, ‘One may _know_ how to conquer without being able to _do_ it,’ whereas here we have the statement that ‘victory’ can be achieved.’ The explanation is, that in the former chapter, where the offensive and defensive are under discussion, it is said that if the enemy is fully prepared, one cannot make certain of beating him. But the present passage refers particularly to the soldiers of Yüeh who, according to Sun Tzŭ’s calculations, will be kept in ignorance of the time and place of the impending struggle. That is why he says here that victory can be achieved.\"]\n\n22\\. Though the enemy be stronger in numbers, we may prevent him from fighting. Scheme so as to discover his plans and the likelihood of their success.\n\n[An alternative reading offered by Chia Lin is: \"Know beforehand all plans conducive to our success and to the enemy’s failure.\"",
    "## Chapter VI. WEAK POINTS AND STRONG\n\n23\\. Rouse him, and learn the principle of his activity or inactivity.\n\n[Chang Yu tells us that by noting the joy or anger shown by the enemy on being thus disturbed, we shall be able to conclude whether his policy is to lie low or the reverse. He instances the action of Cho-ku Liang, who sent the scornful present of a woman’s head-dress to Ssu-ma I, in order to goad him out of his Fabian tactics.]\n\nForce him to reveal himself, so as to find out his vulnerable spots.\n\n24\\. Carefully compare the opposing army with your own, so that you may know where strength is superabundant and where it is deficient.\n\n[Cf. IV. § 6.]\n\n25\\. In making tactical dispositions, the highest pitch you can attain is to conceal them;\n\n[The piquancy of the paradox evaporates in translation. Concealment is perhaps not so much actual invisibility (see _supra_ § 9) as \"showing no sign\" of what you mean to do, of the plans that are formed in your brain.]\n\nconceal your dispositions, and you will be safe from the prying of the subtlest spies, from the machinations of the wisest brains.\n\n[Tu Mu explains: \"Though the enemy may have clever and capable officers, they will not be able to lay any plans against us.\"]\n\n26\\. How victory may be produced for them out of the enemy’s own tactics—that is what the multitude cannot comprehend.",
    "## Chapter VI. WEAK POINTS AND STRONG\n\n27\\. All men can see the tactics whereby I conquer, but what none can see is the strategy out of which victory is evolved.\n\n[_I.e._, everybody can see superficially how a battle is won; what they cannot see is the long series of plans and combinations which has preceded the battle.]\n\n28\\. Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory, but let your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances.\n\n[As Wang Hsi sagely remarks: \"There is but one root-principle underlying victory, but the tactics which lead up to it are infinite in number.\" With this compare Col. Henderson: \"The rules of strategy are few and simple. They may be learned in a week. They may be taught by familiar illustrations or a dozen diagrams. But such knowledge will no more teach a man to lead an army like Napoleon than a knowledge of grammar will teach him to write like Gibbon.\"]\n\n29\\. Military tactics are like unto water; for water in its natural course runs away from high places and hastens downwards.\n\n30\\. So in war, the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what is weak.\n\n[Like water, taking the line of least resistance.]\n\n31\\. Water shapes its course according to the nature of the ground over which it flows; the soldier works out his victory in relation to the foe whom he is facing.\n\n32\\. Therefore, just as water retains no constant shape, so in warfare there are no constant conditions.",
    "## Chapter VI. WEAK POINTS AND STRONG\n\n33\\. He who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent and thereby succeed in winning, may be called a heaven-born captain.\n\n34\\. The five elements (water, fire, wood, metal, earth) are not always equally predominant;\n\n[That is, as Wang Hsi says: \"they predominate alternately.\"]\n\nthe four seasons make way for each other in turn.\n\n[Literally, \"have no invariable seat.\"]\n\nThere are short days and long; the moon has its periods of waning and waxing.\n\n[Cf. V. § 6. The purport of the passage is simply to illustrate the want of fixity in war by the changes constantly taking place in Nature. The comparison is not very happy, however, because the regularity of the phenomena which Sun Tzŭ mentions is by no means paralleled in war.]\n\n[1] See Col. Henderson’s biography of Stonewall Jackson, 1902 ed., vol. II, p. 490.",
    "## Chapter VII. MANŒUVERING",
    "1\\. Sun Tzŭ said: In war, the general receives his commands from the sovereign.\n\n2\\. Having collected an army and concentrated his forces, he must blend and harmonise the different elements thereof before pitching his camp.\n\n[\"Chang Yu says: \"the establishment of harmony and confidence between the higher and lower ranks before venturing into the field;\" and he quotes a saying of Wu Tzŭ (chap. 1 ad init.): \"Without harmony in the State, no military expedition can be undertaken; without harmony in the army, no battle array can be formed.\" In an historical romance Sun Tzŭ is represented as saying to Wu Yuan: \"As a general rule, those who are waging war should get rid of all the domestic troubles before proceeding to attack the external foe.\"]",
    "## Chapter VII. MANŒUVERING\n\n3\\. After that, comes tactical manœuvering, than which there is nothing more difficult.\n\n[I have departed slightly from the traditional interpretation of Ts’ao Kung, who says: \"From the time of receiving the sovereign’s instructions until our encampment over against the enemy, the tactics to be pursued are most difficult.\" It seems to me that the tactics or manœuvers can hardly be said to begin until the army has sallied forth and encamped, and Ch’ien Hao’s note gives color to this view: \"For levying, concentrating, harmonizing and entrenching an army, there are plenty of old rules which will serve. The real difficulty comes when we engage in tactical operations.\" Tu Yu also observes that \"the great difficulty is to be beforehand with the enemy in seizing favourable position.\"]\n\nThe difficulty of tactical manœuvering consists in turning the devious into the direct, and misfortune into gain.",
    "## Chapter VII. MANŒUVERING\n\n[This sentence contains one of those highly condensed and somewhat enigmatical expressions of which Sun Tzŭ is so fond. This is how it is explained by Ts’ao Kung: \"Make it appear that you are a long way off, then cover the distance rapidly and arrive on the scene before your opponent.\" Tu Mu says: \"Hoodwink the enemy, so that he may be remiss and leisurely while you are dashing along with utmost speed.\" Ho Shih gives a slightly different turn: \"Although you may have difficult ground to traverse and natural obstacles to encounter this is a drawback which can be turned into actual advantage by celerity of movement.\" Signal examples of this saying are afforded by the two famous passages across the Alps—that of Hannibal, which laid Italy at his mercy, and that of Napoleon two thousand years later, which resulted in the great victory of Marengo.]",
    "## Chapter VII. MANŒUVERING\n\n4\\. Thus, to take a long and circuitous route, after enticing the enemy out of the way, and though starting after him, to contrive to reach the goal before him, shows knowledge of the artifice of _deviation_.",
    "## Chapter VII. MANŒUVERING\n\n[Tu Mu cites the famous march of Chao She in 270 B.C. to relieve the town of O-yu, which was closely invested by a Ch’in army. The King of Chao first consulted Lien P’o on the advisability of attempting a relief, but the latter thought the distance too great, and the intervening country too rugged and difficult. His Majesty then turned to Chao She, who fully admitted the hazardous nature of the march, but finally said: \"We shall be like two rats fighting in a whole—and the pluckier one will win!\" So he left the capital with his army, but had only gone a distance of 30 _li_ when he stopped and began throwing up entrenchments. For 28 days he continued strengthening his fortifications, and took care that spies should carry the intelligence to the enemy. The Ch’in general was overjoyed, and attributed his adversary’s tardiness to the fact that the beleaguered city was in the Han State, and thus not actually part of Chao territory. But the spies had no sooner departed than Chao She began a forced march lasting for two days and one night, and arrive on the scene of action with such astonishing rapidity that he was able to occupy a commanding position on the \"North hill\" before the enemy had got wind of his movements. A crushing defeat followed for the Ch’in forces, who were obliged to raise the siege of O-yu in all haste and retreat across the border.]",
    "## Chapter VII. MANŒUVERING\n\n5\\. Manœuvering with an army is advantageous; with an undisciplined multitude, most dangerous.\n\n[I adopt the reading of the _T’ung Tien_, Cheng Yu-hsien and the _T’u Shu_, since they appear to apply the exact nuance required in order to make sense. The commentators using the standard text take this line to mean that manœuvers may be profitable, or they may be dangerous: it all depends on the ability of the general.]\n\n6\\. If you set a fully equipped army in march in order to snatch an advantage, the chances are that you will be too late. On the other hand, to detach a flying column for the purpose involves the sacrifice of its baggage and stores.\n\n[Some of the Chinese text is unintelligible to the Chinese commentators, who paraphrase the sentence. I submit my own rendering without much enthusiasm, being convinced that there is some deep-seated corruption in the text. On the whole, it is clear that Sun Tzŭ does not approve of a lengthy march being undertaken without supplies. Cf. infra, § 11.]",
    "## Chapter VII. MANŒUVERING\n\n7\\. Thus, if you order your men to roll up their buff-coats, and make forced marches without halting day or night, covering double the usual distance at a stretch,\n\n[The ordinary day’s march, according to Tu Mu, was 30 _li_; but on one occasion, when pursuing Liu Pei, Ts’ao Ts’ao is said to have covered the incredible distance of 300 _li_ within twenty-four hours.]\n\ndoing a hundred _li_ in order to wrest an advantage, the leaders of all your three divisions will fall into the hands of the enemy.\n\n8\\. The stronger men will be in front, the jaded ones will fall behind, and on this plan only one-tenth of your army will reach its destination.\n\n[The moral is, as Ts’ao Kung and others point out: Don’t march a hundred _li_ to gain a tactical advantage, either with or without impedimenta. Manœuvers of this description should be confined to short distances. Stonewall Jackson said: \"The hardships of forced marches are often more painful than the dangers of battle.\" He did not often call upon his troops for extraordinary exertions. It was only when he intended a surprise, or when a rapid retreat was imperative, that he sacrificed everything for speed. [1] ]\n\n9\\. If you march fifty _li_ in order to outmanœuver the enemy, you will lose the leader of your first division, and only half your force will reach the goal.\n\n[Literally, \"the leader of the first division will be _torn away_.\"]",
    "## Chapter VII. MANŒUVERING\n\n10\\. If you march thirty _li_ with the same object, two-thirds of your army will arrive.\n\n[In the _T’ung Tien_ is added: \"From this we may know the difficulty of manœuvering.\"]\n\n11\\. We may take it then that an army without its baggage-train is lost; without provisions it is lost; without bases of supply it is lost.\n\n[I think Sun Tzŭ meant \"stores accumulated in dépôts.\" But Tu Yu says \"fodder and the like,\" Chang Yu says \"Goods in general,\" and Wang Hsi says \"fuel, salt, foodstuffs, etc.\"]\n\n12\\. We cannot enter into alliances until we are acquainted with the designs of our neighbours.\n\n13\\. We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of the country—its mountains and forests, its pitfalls and precipices, its marshes and swamps.\n\n14\\. We shall be unable to turn natural advantages to account unless we make use of local guides.\n\n[§§. 12-14 are repeated in chap. XI. § 52.]\n\n15\\. In war, practise dissimulation, and you will succeed.\n\n[In the tactics of Turenne, deception of the enemy, especially as to the numerical strength of his troops, took a very prominent position.

    "## Chapter VII. MANŒUVERING\n\n17\\. Let your rapidity be that of the wind,\n\n[The simile is doubly appropriate, because the wind is not only swift but, as Mei Yao-ch’en points out, \"invisible and leaves no tracks.\"]\n\nyour compactness that of the forest.\n\n[Meng Shih comes nearer to the mark in his note: \"When slowly marching, order and ranks must be preserved\"—so as to guard against surprise attacks. But natural forest do not grow in rows, whereas they do generally possess the quality of density or compactness.]\n\n18\\. In raiding and plundering be like fire,\n\n[Cf. _Shih Ching_, IV. 3. iv. 6: \"Fierce as a blazing fire which no man can check.\"]\n\nin immovability like a mountain.\n\n[That is, when holding a position from which the enemy is trying to dislodge you, or perhaps, as Tu Yu says, when he is trying to entice you into a trap.]\n\n19\\. Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt.\n\n[Tu Yu quotes a saying of T’ai Kung which has passed into a proverb: \"You cannot shut your ears to the thunder or your eyes to the lighting—so rapid are they.\" Likewise, an attack should be made so quickly that it cannot be parried.]",
    "## Chapter VII. MANŒUVERING\n\n20\\. When you plunder a countryside, let the spoil be divided amongst your men;\n\n[Sun Tzŭ wishes to lessen the abuses of indiscriminate plundering by insisting that all booty shall be thrown into a common stock, which may afterwards be fairly divided amongst all.]\n\nwhen you capture new territory, cut it up into allotments for the benefit of the soldiery.\n\n[Ch’en Hao says \"quarter your soldiers on the land, and let them sow and plant it.\" It is by acting on this principle, and harvesting the lands they invaded, that the Chinese have succeeded in carrying out some of their most memorable and triumphant expeditions, such as that of Pan Ch’ao who penetrated to the Caspian, and in more recent years, those of Fu-k’ang-an and Tso Tsung-t’ang.]\n\n21\\. Ponder and deliberate before you make a move.\n\n[Chang Yu quotes Wei Liao Tzŭ as saying that we must not break camp until we have gained the resisting power of the enemy and the cleverness of the opposing general.

He will conquer who has learnt the artifice of deviation.\n\n[See _supra_, §§ 3, 4.]\n\nSuch is the art of manœuvering.\n\n[With these words, the chapter would naturally come to an end. But there now follows a long appendix in the shape of an extract from an earlier book on War, now lost, but apparently extant at the time when Sun Tzŭ wrote. The style of this fragment is not noticeably different from that of Sun Tzŭ himself, but no commentator raises a doubt as to its genuineness.]\n\n23\\. The Book of Army Management says:\n\n[It is perhaps significant that none of the earlier commentators give us any information about this work. Mei Yao- Ch’en calls it \"an ancient military classic,\" and Wang Hsi, \"an old book on war.\" Considering the enormous amount of fighting that had gone on for centuries before Sun Tzŭ’s time between the various kingdoms and principalities of China, it is not in itself improbable that a collection of military maxims should have been made and written down at some earlier period.]\n\nOn the field of battle,\n\n[Implied, though not actually in the Chinese.]\n\nthe spoken word does not carry far enough: hence the institution of gongs and drums. Nor can ordinary objects be seen clearly enough: hence the institution of banners and flags.",
    "## Chapter VII. MANŒUVERING\n\n24\\. Gongs and drums, banners and flags, are means whereby the ears and eyes of the host may be focussed on one particular point.\n\n[Chang Yu says: \"If sight and hearing converge simultaneously on the same object, the evolutions of as many as a million soldiers will be like those of a single man.\"!]\n\n25\\. The host thus forming a single united body, is it impossible either for the brave to advance alone, or for the cowardly to retreat alone.\n\n[Chuang Yu quotes a saying: \"Equally guilty are those who advance against orders and those who retreat against orders.\" Tu Mu tells a story in this connection of Wu Ch’i, when he was fighting against the Ch’in State. Before the battle had begun, one of his soldiers, a man of matchless daring, sallied forth by himself, captured two heads from the enemy, and returned to camp. Wu Ch’i had the man instantly executed, whereupon an officer ventured to remonstrate, saying: \"This man was a good soldier, and ought not to have been beheaded.\" Wu Ch’i replied: \"I fully believe he was a good soldier, but I had him beheaded because he acted without orders.\"]\n\nThis is the art of handling large masses of men.",
    "## Chapter VII. MANŒUVERING\n\n26\\. In night-fighting, then, make much use of signal-fires and drums, and in fighting by day, of flags and banners, as a means of influencing the ears and eyes of your army.\n\n[Ch’en Hao alludes to Li Kuang-pi’s night ride to Ho-yang at the head of 500 mounted men; they made such an imposing display with torches, that though the rebel leader Shih Ssu-ming had a large army, he did not dare to dispute their passage.]",
    "## Chapter VII. MANŒUVERING\n\n27\\. A whole army may be robbed of its spirit;",
    "## Chapter VII. MANŒUVERING\n\n[\"In war,\" says Chang Yu, \"if a spirit of anger can be made to pervade all ranks of an army at one and the same time, its onset will be irresistible. Now the spirit of the enemy’s soldiers will be keenest when they have newly arrived on the scene, and it is therefore our cue not to fight at once, but to wait until their ardor and enthusiasm have worn off, and then strike. It is in this way that they may be robbed of their keen spirit.\" Li Ch’uan and others tell an anecdote (to be found in the _Tso Chuan_, year 10, § 1) of Ts’ao Kuei, a protege of Duke Chuang of Lu. The latter State was attacked by Ch’i, and the duke was about to join battle at Ch’ang-cho, after the first roll of the enemy’s drums, when Ts’ao said: \"Not just yet.\" Only after their drums had beaten for the third time, did he give the word for attack. Then they fought, and the men of Ch’i were utterly defeated. Questioned afterwards by the Duke as to the meaning of his delay, Ts’ao Kuei replied: \"In battle, a courageous spirit is everything. Now the first roll of the drum tends to create this spirit, but with the second it is already on the wane, and after the third it is gone altogether. I attacked when their spirit was gone and ours was at its height. Hence our victory.\" Wu Tzŭ (chap. 4) puts \"spirit\" first among the \"four important influences\" in war, and continues: \"The value of a whole army—a mighty host of a million men—is dependent on one man alone: such is the influence of spirit!\"]",
    "## Chapter VII. MANŒUVERING\n\na commander-in-chief may be robbed of his presence of mind.\n\n[Chang Yu says: \"Presence of mind is the general’s most important asset. It is the quality which enables him to discipline disorder and to inspire courage into the panic-stricken.\" The great general Li Ching (A.D. 571-649) has a saying: \"Attacking does not merely consist in assaulting walled cities or striking at an army in battle array; it must include the art of assailing the enemy’s mental equilibrium.\"]",
    "## Chapter VII. MANŒUVERING\n\n28\\. Now a soldier’s spirit is keenest in the morning;\n\n[Always provided, I suppose, that he has had breakfast. At the battle of the Trebia, the Romans were foolishly allowed to fight fasting, whereas Hannibal’s men had breakfasted at their leisure. See Livy, XXI, liv. 8, lv. 1 and 8.]\n\nby noonday it has begun to flag; and in the evening, his mind is bent only on returning to camp.\n\n29\\. A clever general, therefore, avoids an army when its spirit is keen, but attacks it when it is sluggish and inclined to return. This is the art of studying moods.\n\n30\\. Disciplined and calm, to await the appearance of disorder and hubbub amongst the enemy:—this is the art of retaining self-possession.\n\n31\\. To be near the goal while the enemy is still far from it, to wait at ease while the enemy is toiling and struggling, to be well-fed while the enemy is famished:—this is the art of husbanding one’s strength.\n\n32\\. To refrain from intercepting an enemy whose banners are in perfect order, to refrain from attacking an army drawn up in calm and confident array:—this is the art of studying circumstances.\n\n33\\. It is a military axiom not to advance uphill against the enemy, nor to oppose him when he comes downhill.\n\n34\\. Do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight; do not attack soldiers whose temper is keen.",
    "## Chapter VII. MANŒUVERING\n\n35\\. Do not swallow a bait offered by the enemy.\n\n[Li Ch’uan and Tu Mu, with extraordinary inability to see a metaphor, take these words quite literally of food and drink that have been poisoned by the enemy. Ch’en Hao and Chang Yu carefully point out that the saying has a wider application.]\n\nDo not interfere with an army that is returning home.",
    "## Chapter VII. MANŒUVERING\n\n[The commentators explain this rather singular piece of advice by saying that a man whose heart is set on returning home will fight to the death against any attempt to bar his way, and is therefore too dangerous an opponent to be tackled. Chang Yu quotes the words of Han Hsin: \"Invincible is the soldier who hath his desire and returneth homewards.\" A marvelous tale is told of Ts’ao Ts’ao’s courage and resource in ch. 1 of the _San Kuo Chi_, In 198 A.D., he was besieging Chang Hsiu in Jang, when Liu Piao sent reinforcements with a view to cutting off Ts’ao’s retreat. The latter was obliged to draw off his troops, only to find himself hemmed in between two enemies, who were guarding each outlet of a narrow pass in which he had engaged himself. In this desperate plight Ts’ao waited until nightfall, when he bored a tunnel into the mountain side and laid an ambush in it. As soon as the whole army had passed by, the hidden troops fell on his rear, while Ts’ao himself turned and met his pursuers in front, so that they were thrown into confusion and annihilated. Ts’ao Ts’ao said afterwards: \"The brigands tried to check my army in its retreat and brought me to battle in a desperate position: hence I knew how to overcome them.\"]",
    "## Chapter VII. MANŒUVERING\n\n36\\. When you surround an army, leave an outlet free.\n\n[This does not mean that the enemy is to be allowed to escape. The object, as Tu Mu puts it, is \"to make him believe that there is a road to safety, and thus prevent his fighting with the courage of despair.\" Tu Mu adds pleasantly: \"After that, you may crush him.\"]\n\nDo not press a desperate foe too hard.",
    "## Chapter VII. MANŒUVERING\n\n[Ch’en Hao quotes the saying: \"Birds and beasts when brought to bay will use their claws and teeth.\" Chang Yu says: \"If your adversary has burned his boats and destroyed his cooking-pots, and is ready to stake all on the issue of a battle, he must not be pushed to extremities.\" Ho Shih illustrates the meaning by a story taken from the life of Yen-ch’ing. That general, together with his colleague Tu Chung-wei was surrounded by a vastly superior army of Khitans in the year 945 A.D. The country was bare and desert-like, and the little Chinese force was soon in dire straits for want of water. The wells they bored ran dry, and the men were reduced to squeezing lumps of mud and sucking out the moisture. Their ranks thinned rapidly, until at last Fu Yen-ch’ing exclaimed: \"We are desperate men. Far better to die for our country than to go with fettered hands into captivity!\" A strong gale happened to be blowing from the northeast and darkening the air with dense clouds of sandy dust. To Chung-wei was for waiting until this had abated before deciding on a final attack; but luckily another officer, Li Shou-cheng by name, was quicker to see an opportunity, and said: \"They are many and we are few, but in the midst of this sandstorm our numbers will not be discernible; victory will go to the strenuous fighter, and the wind will be our best ally.\" Accordingly, Fu Yen-ch’ing made a sudden and wholly unexpected onslaught with his cavalry, routed the barbarians and succeeded in breaking through to safety.]",

I do not know what Ts’ao Kung makes these Nine Variations out to be, but it has been suggested that they are connected with the Nine Situations\" - of chapt. XI. This is the view adopted by Chang Yu.

    "## Chapter VIII. VARIATION OF TACTICS\n\n[Cf. III. § 4 Ts’ao Kung gives an interesting illustration from his own experience. When invading the territory of Hsu-chou, he ignored the city of Hua-pi, which lay directly in his path, and pressed on into the heart of the country. This excellent strategy was rewarded by the subsequent capture of no fewer than fourteen important district cities. Chang Yu says: \"No town should be attacked which, if taken, cannot be held, or if left alone, will not cause any trouble.\" Hsun Ying, when urged to attack Pi-yang, replied: \"The city is small and well-fortified; even if I succeed intaking it, it will be no great feat of arms; whereas if I fail, I shall make myself a laughing-stock.\" In the seventeenth century, sieges still formed a large proportion of war. It was Turenne who directed attention to the importance of marches, countermarches and manœuvers. He said: \"It is a great mistake to waste men in taking a town when the same expenditure of soldiers will gain a province.\" [1] ]\n\npositions which must not be contested, commands of the sovereign which must not be obeyed.\n\n[This is a hard saying for the Chinese, with their reverence for authority, and Wei Liao Tzŭ (quoted by Tu Mu) is moved to exclaim: \"Weapons are baleful instruments, strife is antagonistic to virtue, a military commander is the negation of civil order!\" The unpalatable fact remains, however, that even Imperial wishes must be subordinated to military necessity.]",
    "## Chapter VIII. VARIATION OF TACTICS\n\n4\\. The general who thoroughly understands the advantages that accompany variation of tactics knows how to handle his troops.\n\n5\\. The general who does not understand these, may be well acquainted with the configuration of the country, yet he will not be able to turn his knowledge to practical account.\n\n[Literally, \"get the advantage of the ground,\" which means not only securing good positions, but availing oneself of natural advantages in every possible way. Chang Yu says: \"Every kind of ground is characterized by certain natural features, and also gives scope for a certain variability of plan. How it is possible to turn these natural features to account unless topographical knowledge is supplemented by versatility of mind?\"]",
    "## Chapter VIII. VARIATION OF TACTICS\n\n6\\. So, the student of war who is unversed in the art of war of varying his plans, even though he be acquainted with the Five Advantages, will fail to make the best use of his men.\n\n[Chia Lin tells us that these imply five obvious and generally advantageous lines of action, namely: \"if a certain road is short, it must be followed; if an army is isolated, it must be attacked; if a town is in a parlous condition, it must be besieged; if a position can be stormed, it must be attempted; and if consistent with military operations, the ruler’s commands must be obeyed.\" But there are circumstances which sometimes forbid a general to use these advantages. For instance, \"a certain road may be the shortest way for him, but if he knows that it abounds in natural obstacles, or that the enemy has laid an ambush on it, he will not follow that road. A hostile force may be open to attack, but if he knows that it is hard-pressed and likely to fight with desperation, he will refrain from striking,\" and so on.]\n\n7\\. Hence in the wise leader’s plans, considerations of advantage and of disadvantage will be blended together.\n\n[\"Whether in an advantageous position or a disadvantageous one,\" says Ts’ao Kung, \"the opposite state should be always present to your mind.\"]",
    "## Chapter VIII. VARIATION OF TACTICS\n\n8\\. If our expectation of advantage be tempered in this way, we may succeed in accomplishing the essential part of our schemes.\n\n[Tu Mu says: \"If we wish to wrest an advantage from the enemy, we must not fix our minds on that alone, but allow for the possibility of the enemy also doing some harm to us, and let this enter as a factor into our calculations.\"]\n\n9\\. If, on the other hand, in the midst of difficulties we are always ready to seize an advantage, we may extricate ourselves from misfortune.\n\n[Tu Mu says: \"If I wish to extricate myself from a dangerous position, I must consider not only the enemy’s ability to injure me, but also my own ability to gain an advantage over the enemy. If in my counsels these two considerations are properly blended, I shall succeed in liberating myself…. For instance; if I am surrounded by the enemy and only think of effecting an escape, the nervelessness of my policy will incite my adversary to pursue and crush me; it would be far better to encourage my men to deliver a bold counter-attack, and use the advantage thus gained to free myself from the enemy’s toils.\" See the story of Ts’ao Ts’ao, VII. § 35, note.]"
