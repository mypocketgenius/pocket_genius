    "## Harry Dry's Step-by-Step Landing Page Formula\n\nA complete framework for building high-converting landing pages, covering title copywriting, subtitles, visuals, social proof, CTAs, features, objection handling, FAQs, and founder's notes. Based on real-world examples from companies like Privy, Stripe, Smile Direct Club, Riverside, and Everydae.\n\nThere's two parts of a landing page: what's immediately visible (above the fold) and what the user scrolls to (below the fold). To quote Donald Miller, a caveman should be able to glance at the above-the-fold and immediately grunt back what you offer.\n\nThe above-the-fold formula has five elements:\n1. Explain the value you provide (title)\n2. Explain how you'll create it (subtitle)\n3. Let the user visualise it (visual)\n4. Make it believable (social proof)\n5. Make taking the next step easy (CTA)\n\n**Example — Everydae (all 5 above-the-fold elements):**\n- [1] Title: \"Ace the SAT with just 10-minutes of studying a day\"\n- [2] Subtitle: \"10-min microlessons designed to boost confidence and make SAT strategies easy to remember.\"\n- [3] Visual: Video of a student in action with caption \"See Everydae in action :)\"\n- [4] Social proof: User photos with \"5/5 from 700+ users\" star rating\n- [5] CTA: \"Get started for just $1\"",
    "## 1/ Title — Explain your value clearly\n\nThere's one hundred ways to write a great title. Here are three patterns.\n\n**Pattern A: Explain what you do.** When your product is unique, explain what you do as simply as possible.\n- Quantum: \"Coffee-Infused Energy Bars\"\n- Muzzle: \"Silence embarrassing notifications while screensharing\"\n- Veles: \"97% of this cleaner is made from food waste\"\n- Fast: \"One click. No passwords. The world's fastest checkout.\"\n\n**Pattern B: Hooks.** Most products aren't unique. A hook adds oomph by addressing your customer's biggest objection. The formula is VALUE → OBJECTION → VALUE + HOOK:\n- \"Rank higher on Google\" → Objection: \"I suck at SEO\" → \"You don't have to be an SEO pro to rank higher on Google\"\n- \"Ace the SAT\" → Objection: \"I bet it's hard work\" → \"Ace the SAT with just 10 minutes of studying per day\"\n- \"Erectile dysfunction pills\" → Objection: \"I can't ask my doctor\" → \"Erectile dysfunction pills. Direct to your door\"\n\n**Pattern C: Own your niche.** Some startups transcend hooks. Own your niche in one line. Write with conviction. You're THE solution.\n- Privy: \"How Small Brands Sell More Online\"\n- Basecamp: \"The All-In-One Toolkit For Working Remotely\"\n- Descript: \"It's How You Make a Podcast\"\n- SparkLoop: \"The Referral Tool for Newsletters\"",
    "## 2/ Subtitle — Get specific about how\n\nSubtitles are where you get specific. Introduce the product. Explain how it creates the value in your title. Formula: Title = the value you provide. Subtitle = introduce the product + how it creates that value.\n\n**Examples — Title and subtitle pairs:**\n- Dormio — Title: \"Your most restful sleep is just a sip away\" / Subtitle: \"Calming teas that help you relax, unwind, and drift into a deep, restorative sleep.\"\n- Privy — Title: \"How small brands sell more online\" / Subtitle: \"Privy's conversion, email marketing, and text messaging tools help you get more customers from your traffic.\"\n- Everydae — Title: \"Ace the SAT with just 10-minutes of studying a day\" / Subtitle: \"10-min microlessons designed to boost confidence and make SAT strategies easy to remember.\"",
    "## 3/ Visual — Show the product in action\n\nShow off your product in all its glory. The goal is to get as close to reality as possible. Don't show fancy illustrations. Show your product. Or even better, your product in action.\n\n**Examples — Landing page visuals:**\n- Quip: \"Better oral health, made simple\" — shows a real child brushing teeth with a Quip toothbrush (product in action)\n- Yumwoof: \"Scroll down if your dog likes tasty food\" — shows real product photos of their Perfect Kibble alongside an illustrated dog mascot\n- Stripe: \"Payments infrastructure for the internet\" — shows real product screenshots: payment form UI, dashboard with revenue graphs, and transaction data\n- Smile Direct Club: \"A smile you'll love for less than $3 per day\" — shows a grid of real customer selfies showing their smiles (real results)",
    "## 4/ Social Proof — Make your promise believable\n\nSocial proof above the fold adds instant credibility to the value you're promising. Any startup can write \"How small brands sell more online\". But Privy's \"18,000+ reviews\" are what make you believe it.\n\n**Examples — Above-the-fold social proof types:**\n- Privy: Shopify logo + \"18,000+ Reviews\" + \"The most reviewed platform on Shopify\" (platform reviews)\n- Hey: Press badges from Gear Patrol (\"best new tech products of 2020\") and Popular Science (\"100 greatest innovations of 2020\") above the title \"Email's new heyday\" (press credibility)\n- Userback: Customer quote — \"This app rocks!\" — Daniel Beucher, Mozilla (authority testimonial)\n- Podcast launch app: Stat-based — \"In 2020 we've helped 258 podcasts rack up 17,679,124 downloads\" with podcast cover art (real numbers)",
    "## 5/ CTA — Make the next step easy\n\nYour CTA makes taking the next step easy. Most buttons emphasise action: Sign Up, Start Trial etc. Here are four more compelling CTA types.\n\n**Type 1: Call to value.** Buttons which emphasise \"value\" over \"action\" usually perform better. The trick is to fulfil the value your title promises.\n- Title: \"Record podcasts in studio quality\" → CTA button: \"Start recording\"\n- Title: \"Learn why users leave your site\" → CTA button: \"Show me my heatmap\"\n\n**Type 2: Objection handle.** Add a few words to your CTA to handle the user's biggest objection to clicking. Formula: CTA → OBJECTION → OBJECTION HANDLED:\n- \"Start Free!\" → Objection: \"I bet it asks for my credit card\" → \"Start Free! No CC Required\"\n- \"Try Prisma\" → Objection: \"I don't have time\" → \"Try Prisma in 5 minutes\"\n- \"Get started\" → Objection: \"I bet this is expensive\" → \"Get started for just $1\"\n\n**Type 3: Humanize your CTA.** Make the CTA feel personal by adding three elements: a face, a name, and reassurance.\n- Before: \"Book a demo\" (generic, impersonal)\n- After: Photo of a real person + \"Book a demo with Harry\" + \"(friendly tour, not a sales pitch)\"\n- The three elements: 1/ Face (photo builds trust), 2/ Name (makes it personal), 3/ Reassurance (handles the objection that demos are high-pressure sales pitches)",
    "## 5/ CTA — Make the next step easy\n\n**Type 4: Email capture + CTA.** Pair email capture with your CTA to make signing up as easy as possible. This doesn't mean sacrificing customer info. You can collect during onboarding.",
    "## Above the fold — Full examples\n\nIn five seconds customers try to establish whether or not you can help them. Make their life easy. Clarity over creativity. Here are three complete above-the-fold examples with all five elements annotated.\n\n**Smile Direct Club:**\n- [1] Title: \"A smile you'll love for less than $3 per day.\"\n- [2] Subtitle: \"Safely straighten teeth 100% from home in as little as 4-6 months, for less than $3/day.\"\n- [3] Visual: Grid of real customer selfies showing their smiles\n- [4] Social proof: \"We're taking steps to protect your health. Learn More\"\n- [5] CTA: \"AM I A CANDIDATE?\"\n\n**LearnWorlds:**\n- [1] Title: \"Create and sell online courses from your own website\"\n- [2] Subtitle: \"The best online course platform for creating, selling and promoting your online courses. Start monetizing your skills, experiences and your audience.\"\n- [3] Visual: Product dashboard screenshot and course video player\n- [4] Social proof: \"Featured in Forbes, MIT Technology Review, NeilPatel, eLearning Industry\"\n- [5] CTA: Email capture field + \"Get Started Free\"",
    "## Above the fold — Full examples\n\n**Bold.org:**\n- [1] Title: \"You're ready to give back. We're here to help.\"\n- [2] Subtitle: \"Create scholarships and grants for the people and causes you care most about.\"\n- [3] Visual: Photo of a Bold.org Grant Winner with testimonial quote\n- [4] Social proof: \"Grants featured by: Harvard, UCLA, Berkeley, Georgetown, University of Michigan, Syracuse University\"\n- [5] CTA: \"Create a Grant\" + \"How it Works\" + \"100% Goes To Your Recipients\" + \"100% Tax Deductible\"",
    "## Below the fold — Earning the sale\n\nAbove the fold you earn the customer's attention. Below the fold you earn the sale. The below-the-fold formula has five more elements:\n6. Make the value concrete (features and objections)\n7. Inspire action (social proof)\n8. Tie up loose ends (FAQ)\n9. Repeat your call to action (2nd CTA)\n10. Make yourself memorable (Founder's note)",
    "## 6/ Features and Objections — Make the value concrete\n\nThe first thing you do below the fold is make concrete the value you promise above the fold. Take Riverside for example. Their title promises \"podcasts that look and sound amazing\". Their first two features make this promise concrete.\n\n**Example — Riverside's features making \"look and sound amazing\" concrete:**\n- Feature 1: \"Local recordings in 4K video quality\" — shows side-by-side comparison of cloud recording (720p, blurry) vs. local recording (4K, crisp and clear)\n- Feature 2: \"Uncompressed crystal clear audio\" — shows audio player comparison: \"Recorded with Riverside\" vs. \"Recorded with Zoom\" to demonstrate the quality difference\n\nThe second thing you do is handle your customer's biggest objections. Talk to customers. Group together reoccurring objections. Use their own words to handle them.\n\n**Example — Riverside handling objections about complexity:**\n- Customer objections: \"Is it simple?\", \"Is setup easy?\", \"I suck at tech\"\n- Heading: \"So simple Grandma can use it\"\n- Body: \"Guests join with just one click. Nothing to download. No need to make an account. We built this for non-techies.\"",
    "## 7/ More Social Proof — Inspire action with real customers\n\nAbove the fold social proof is about credibility. Below the fold social proof is about inspiring action. It's a free pass to sell your product. Use existing customers to bring to life the value you promise. Match your social proof type to your title's promise.\n\n**Examples — Below-the-fold social proof types:**\n- Smile Direct Club (real customers): Title promises \"Get a smile you love\" → Shows grid of real customer before/after selfies — people genuinely smiling with their results\n- Hey (real words): Title promises \"We've reinvented email\" → Shows customer testimonials like Mike Davidson: \"If you designed email from scratch such that it vigorously protected your privacy and your time, this is what it would look like. I think you're going to love it.\" and Kris, MBA: \"Let me tell ya'll something: Hey is going to change the way we use email. Bye-bye Gmail. Helllooooo Hey.\"\n- Privy (real numbers): Title promises \"How small brands sell more\" → Shows stat: \"500,000+ businesses from 180+ countries have generated $3.9+ billion in sales with Privy. So we're pretty sure it'll work for you too\"",
    "## 8/ FAQ — Handle remaining objections\n\nThere's going to be features and objections you want to mention that don't fit neatly above. This is where your FAQ comes in. Write them down. Reframe into questions and answers. Use FAQs to either handle objections or sneak in selling points.\n\n**Example — Two FAQ patterns:**\n- Objection handled: \"What if it's not right for me?\" → \"No problem! Just send an email and we'll refund you, no questions asked.\" (Handles the risk objection by removing buyer's remorse fear)\n- Selling point: \"Can I expense this?\" → \"Yes! In fact we've pre-written an email template to make it easier to ask your manager.\" (Turns a question into a selling point by making the purchase even easier)",
    "## 9/ 2nd CTA — Remind them why they're clicking\n\nWe've done the hard selling. It's time for the 2nd CTA. This time we've got the luxury of space. So instead of dropping one measly button, remind the customer why they're clicking.\n\n**Example — Streak for Gmail's 2nd CTA section (annotated):**\n- Happy users: Row of customer profile photos across the top\n- Reiterate value: \"Join hundreds of businesses who are doing more with email.\"\n- Testimonial for \"immediate results\": \"I saw immediate results. I got more replies and closed more deals, all inside Gmail.\" — Fabrizio Rinaldi\n- 2nd CTA button: \"Add to Gmail with one click\"",
    "## 10/ Founder's Note — Make yourself memorable\n\nFinally, leave the customer with a story that makes you easy to sum up. The founder's note follows a 4-step story structure: 1/ Put yourself in their shoes, 2/ Explain their problem, 3/ Take ownership of it, 4/ Show the happy ending. You're walking them down a path they'll want to walk themselves. People buy from people.\n\n**Example — Privy's founder's note by Ben Jabbawy, CEO & Founder (4-step story structure):**\n- [Customer's shoes]: \"Out of the 12+ million stores online, only 8% will sell more than $1,000 in products this year.\" + \"Yup — while it's easier than ever to build an online store (thanks, Shopify!), it's harder than ever to grow it.\"\n- [Explain their problem]: \"Most ecommerce brands have two challenges with growth: 1. Getting people to make their first purchase. 2. Getting the people who do to come back and buy again\"\n- [Take ownership]: \"That's why we built Privy — to give small ecommerce brands like yours a leg-up.\"\n- [Happy ending]: \"In the last ten years we've helped over 600k stores (like yours) generate $5 billion in sales. I'd love for you to give it a try.\"",
