    "# Evaluating User Story Quality with the INVEST Framework",
    "## Standard Format\n\n```\nAs a <role>, I want <capability>, so that <benefit>.\n```",
    "## Role in Agile Development\n\nAgile teams consume user stories as their fundamental unit of work and deliver product increments against them. Ownership of story authorship falls to the Product Owner or equivalent product-facing role. The quality bar for what constitutes a well-constructed story is codified by six criteria, remembered through the mnemonic **INVEST**.",
    "## Criteria Overview\n\n| Criterion | Core Question |\n|-----------|---------------|\n| **I**ndependent | Can this story be prioritized and built without sequencing constraints? |\n| **N**egotiable | Does the story leave room for collaborative refinement? |\n| **V**aluable | Is there a clear, identifiable benefit tied to completion? |\n| **E**stimable | Can the team reasonably gauge the effort required? |\n| **S**mall | Is the scope narrow enough to finish within a single iteration? |\n| **T**estable | Can acceptance criteria be defined right now? |\n\n---",
    "### Independent\n\nA well-formed story has no ordering constraints relative to other stories — any story in the backlog should be eligible for selection regardless of what else has or has not been completed. This property protects prioritization: without it, high-value work can become hostage to low-value prerequisites.",
    "### Negotiable\n\nA story describes intent, not a binding specification. It exists to initiate dialogue — at minimum among the customer (or their proxy, such as the Product Owner), the developer, and the tester. Through that dialogue, the team converges on an outcome that genuinely addresses the underlying need. Rigid adherence to story wording at the expense of the actual goal is a failure mode. Targeted clarifying questions are the primary tool for surfacing hidden assumptions and refining scope.",
    "### Valuable\n\nEvery story must deliver an identifiable benefit or it has no place in the backlog. Backlog ordering should reflect this — higher-benefit stories rise to the top.\n\n\"Benefit\" is not limited to what end users or customers directly perceive. It encompasses internal concerns traditionally labeled \"non-functional requirements\" — performance, security, maintainability, and similar qualities. The relevant measure is whether the specific role named in the story's `<role>` field is meaningfully served.\n\nThe `so that <benefit>` clause in the template exists precisely to force explicit articulation of what completing the story delivers.",
    "### Estimable\n\nThe team must be able to gauge effort so that benefit can be weighed against cost during prioritization. A high-benefit story requiring disproportionate effort may justifiably rank below cheaper alternatives.\n\nWhen a story resists estimation:\n1. **Decompose it** — splitting often exposes the ambiguity that blocks sizing.\n2. **If decomposition is insufficient, run a spike** — a focused, research-only activity to resolve the unknowns.\n3. **Spikes must be timeboxed.** Without a fixed boundary, investigative work expands to fill all available capacity, displacing productive delivery.",
    "### Small\n\nAppropriate story size varies by team and process cadence. A practical benchmark for two-week iterations: stories should average **3–4 total days of effort**, encompassing every activity required to reach a \"done\" state (development, testing, review, etc.).\n\nThe governing principle is to implement the minimum that satisfies the need — no embellishment beyond that. Gold-plating is waste.",
    "### Testable\n\nA story that cannot be verified cannot be declared done. The operational test for this criterion: **acceptance criteria should be writable at the moment the story is authored.** If they cannot be, the story is underspecified.\n\nDefining acceptance criteria early produces three compounding benefits:\n- It forces collaborative alignment before implementation begins.\n- It shifts quality assurance upstream, catching problems earlier.\n- It creates a natural on-ramp to acceptance test-driven development (ATDD).\n\nAs with Negotiable, clarifying questions serve as the mechanism for surfacing what \"done\" looks like.\n\n---",
    "## Aggregate Effect\n\nConsistent application of these six criteria directly addresses the most common user story defects — hidden dependencies, excessive scope, and unverifiable outcomes. The result is more predictable planning and higher sustained throughput."
