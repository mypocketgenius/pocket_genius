## Rewriting Landing Pages with a Pro Copywriter

Harry Dry teamed up with Annie Maguire, a professional copywriter, to rewrite real landing page titles submitted by startups. Each rewrite demonstrates a core copywriting principle: clarity over cleverness, selling outcomes not features, leading with your uniqueness, replacing vague language with specifics, and handling customer objections.

## 1) Everydae — Lead with value, not jargon

**Before → After rewrite (Everydae):**
- Before: Title: "Meet the next generation of SAT prep." / Subtitle: "Ace the SAT in 10 Mins / Day" / 5 stars / CTA: "Watch the Video"
- After: Title: "Ace the SAT with just 10-minutes of studying a day" / CTA: "Get started for just $1" / Social proof: user photos + "5/5 (from 700+ users)"
- Lesson: Put yourself in the customer's shoes. Kids don't care about "the next generation of SAT prep" — they care about acing the SAT. The real value was buried in the subtitle, so pull it up to the title. The $1 trial was hidden — make it the CTA. And make social proof feel REALER with user photos and a specific count instead of anonymous stars.

## 2) Banquist — Let a unique product speak for itself

**Before → After rewrite (Banquist):**
- Before: Title: "Become a Masterchef." / CTA: "Book Now"
- After: Title: "Virtual cooking classes. Taught by Michelin-star chefs." / CTA: "Book Now"
- Lesson: "Become a Masterchef" is vague — it could mean fifty different things. Banquist is a unique product, so the golden rule is to let the product speak for itself. The rewrite explains exactly what it is (virtual cooking classes) and what makes it special (Michelin-star chefs). When your product is unique, clarity beats cleverness.

## 3) Dormio — Sell the outcome, not the product

**Before → After rewrite (Dormio):**
- Before: Title: "Peace of mind in a cup" / Subtitle: "calming and sleepy teas" / CTA: "SHOP NOW"
- After: Title: "Your most restful sleep is just a sip away" / Subtitle: "Calming teas that help you relax, unwind, and drift into deep, restorative sleep." / CTA: "SHOP NOW"
- Lesson: Customers buy outcomes, not products. "Peace of mind in a cup" is abstract. The rewrite sells the outcome the customer actually wants — deep, restorative sleep. The subtitle paints a vivid picture of the journey: relax, unwind, drift into sleep. Outcome-driven copy is always more compelling than product-description copy.

## 4) JobBoardSheet — Handle objections with specifics

**Before → After rewrite (JobBoardSheet):**
- Before: Title: "Create a job board from Google Sheets or Airtable" / Subtitle: "Run a successful job board business from a spreadsheet. No code, design skills required." / CTA: "Start Free Trial"
- After: Title: "Get a fully functional job board in 10 minutes, without writing code or paying $1000+" / Subtitle: "Run a successful job board business from a spreadsheet. No code, design skills required."
- Lesson: The original copy is clear but forgettable. The rewrite handles the customer's four main objections in one sentence: QUALITY ("fully functional"), TIME ("10 minutes"), DIFFICULTY ("without writing code"), and COST ("paying $1000+"). Each objection is addressed with a specific, concrete detail. Specifics make copy memorable.

## 5) Silva — Sell the adventure, not the specs

**Before → After rewrite (Silva):**
- Before: Title: "TRAIL RUNNER FREE" / Subtitle: "The World's Most Comfortable Headlamp" / CTA: "DISCOVER TRAIL RUNNER FREE"
- After: Title: "A SPOTLIGHT FOR ALL YOUR ADVENTURES" / Subtitle: "Meet the Award-winning Headlamp Athletes rely on to Light the Path Ahead"
- Lesson: "Trail Runner Free" is confusing — is that the product name? Is it free? And there's no emotional pull. People don't get excited by a new headlamp — they get excited by new adventures. Sell the emotion your product enables, not the product specs.

## 6) Socios — Own the real problem, add social proof

**Before → After rewrite (Socios):**
- Before: Title: "Get Fan Tokens, vote on exclusive team surveys & be rewarded" / CTA: "Get the app"
- After: Title: "How fans get their voice heard" / Subtitle: "Join 100k football fans having their say about the club they love" / CTA: "Get the app" / Social proof: club logos (Barcelona, etc.) + "100+ clubs"
- Lesson: Football fans don't care about "tokens", "surveys", and "rewards" — that's product jargon. The real problem Socios solves is that fans want their voices heard. Take ownership of the real problem. Also, add social proof — you're literally working with Barcelona and 100+ clubs! Don't hide your best assets.

## 7) Counterweight Creative — Replace vague words with specifics

**Before → After rewrite (Counterweight Creative):**
- Before: Title: "Become the go-to authority in your space through podcasting" / Subtitle: "Connect with the right people and become the one and only in your health + wellness niche" / CTA: "Find out how"
- After: Title: "A proven framework for launching your health & wellness podcast" / Social proof: "In 2020 we've helped 258 podcasts rack up 17,679,124 downloads" + podcast cover art
- Lesson: The original language is too vague — "go-to authority", "right people", "one and only" all feel like empty promises that don't feel REAL. The rewrite replaces every vague word with a specific one: "proven framework", "health & wellness podcast", "258 podcasts", "17,679,124 downloads". You can't bullshit specifics.

## 8) Haako — Condense, don't overload

**Before → After rewrite (Haako):**
- Before: Title: "Haako - Wheels at your door" / Body: A huge text block: "Haako is an ultimate solution for hotel guests in order to explore the nearby areas, go to work, or to meet the loved ones. We provide Bikes and Electric-scooters to get you where you want to go..."
- After: Title: "The fun, fast & sustainable way to explore new cities" / Visual: Photo of someone riding a bike on a sunny beachfront
- Lesson: You can't expect people to read a huge text block to understand your product. Condense the entire value into one sentence. Add an image to bring the product to life — show someone actually using it. Repackaging matters as much as rewriting. Sometimes less copy is better copy.

## 9) Ladybird — Lead with what makes you unique

**Before → After rewrite (Ladybird):**
- Before: Title: "Pass First Time" + "Get Driving Lessons Dublin" / CTAs: "EDT", "Auto", "Pretest", "Car Hire" (four separate buttons)
- After: Title: "Ireland's only all-female Instructor driving school" / Subtitle: "Get driving lessons in Dublin at your pace and within your budget."
- Lesson: Ladybird's uniqueness is that all their instructors are female — but they buried it halfway down the page and led with a generic "Get Driving Lessons Dublin" instead. Don't bury your differentiator. Lead with it. Write the title only you can write.
